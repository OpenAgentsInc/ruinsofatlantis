# Armor and Shields

Armor is categorized as Light, Medium, or Heavy. The Armor table in the SRD lists base AC, Strength requirements, Stealth, weight, and cost. Wearing a Shield adds +2 to AC and requires a free hand. You can don or doff armor and shields per the times noted in the table.

Armor Training: Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but you add your Proficiency Bonus to AC from armor only if you’re proficient with that type of armor.

Stealth: If an armor’s Stealth column lists “Disadvantage,” the wearer has Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
