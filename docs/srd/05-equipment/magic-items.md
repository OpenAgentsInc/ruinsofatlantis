# Magic Items (Using, Identifying, Attunement)

Identifying a Magic Item: Use the Identify spell or focus on the item during a Short Rest to learn its properties and use; Potions can be sampled to learn effects.

Attunement: Some items require Attunement to use their magical properties. Attune during a Short Rest spent in contact with the item; at the end, you’re attuned.
- You can be attuned to no more than three items at a time and can’t attune to more than one copy of the same item.
- Ending Attunement: Ends if you no longer meet prerequisites, are away from the item for over 100 feet for 24+ hours, if you die, if another creature attunes to the item, or voluntarily by spending a Short Rest.

Wearing and Wielding Items: Wear or wield as intended; many items adjust to fit the wearer.

Multiple Items of the Same Kind and Paired Items: Don’t benefit from more than one item of the same body slot; paired items require both worn.
