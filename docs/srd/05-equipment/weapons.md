# Weapons

The weapons list shows cost, weight, category, damage, properties, and mastery. See also “Weapon Properties” and “Mastery Properties.” Equipment sells for half cost. Weapon proficiency adds your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls with that weapon.

Tables are being transcribed from the PDF. Until then, refer to the SRD for the full weapon table. Properties and mastery definitions are included separately in this section.
