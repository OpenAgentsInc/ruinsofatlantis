# Scribing Spell Scrolls

A spellcaster can create a Spell Scroll.

- Time and Cost. Based on spell level (e.g., Cantrip: 1 day, 15 GP; 1st level: 1 day, 25 GP; 2nd level: 3 days, 100 GP; … up to 9th level: 120 days, 50,000 GP).
- Prerequisites. Proficiency in Arcana or Calligrapher’s Supplies; have the spell prepared during inscription; have any required Material components (consumed only on completion if consumed by the spell). The scroll uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
- Cantrips. Work as if the caster were your level.
