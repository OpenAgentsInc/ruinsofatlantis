# Mastery Properties

These are usable only if a feature unlocks weapon mastery for you.

- Cleave. On a hit with a melee attack, make one additional melee attack against a second creature within 5 feet of the first and within your reach. On a hit, deal the weapon’s damage (no ability modifier unless negative). Once per turn.
- Graze. If your attack roll misses a creature, deal damage equal to the ability modifier used for the attack; same damage type as the weapon.
- Nick. The extra attack of the Light property can be made as part of the Attack action instead of a Bonus Action. Once per turn.
- Push. On a hit, push the target up to 10 feet straight away if it is Large or smaller.
- Sap. On a hit, the creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.
- Slow. On a hit that deals damage, reduce the target’s Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn (doesn’t stack above 10 feet).
- Topple. On a hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution save (DC 8 + your ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus) or have the Prone condition.
- Vex. On a hit that deals damage, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.
