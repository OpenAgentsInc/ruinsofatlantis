# Step 3: Ability Scores

Generate scores using one method:
- Standard Array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
- Random Generation: Roll 4d6 and keep the highest three; repeat until you have six numbers.
- Point Cost: Spend 27 points based on the Ability Score Point Costs.

Ability Score Point Costs: 8=0, 9=1, 10=2, 11=3, 12=4, 13=5, 14=7, 15=9.

Assign the six numbers to your abilities, then apply background increases. Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table (3: −4; 4–5: −3; 6–7: −2; 8–9: −1; 10–11: +0; 12–13: +1; 14–15: +2; 16–17: +3; 18–19: +4).
