# Starting at Higher Levels

If the GM starts at higher than level 1, begin with the minimum XP for that level. Equipment may be above standard level 1 gear at the GM’s discretion. See “Starting Equipment at Higher Levels” for guidance on money and magic items by starting level.

- Bonus Feats at Level 20. As advancement beyond level 20, a GM can award one feat per 30,000 XP above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon feats are especially appropriate.
