# Step 4: Choose Alignment

Alignment combines morality (good, evil, neutral) and attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, neutral). Summaries:
- Lawful Good: Do the right thing as expected by society.
- Neutral Good: Do the best you can, within or outside rules.
- Chaotic Good: Act as conscience directs.
- Lawful Neutral: Follow law, tradition, or personal codes.
- Neutral: Avoid moral questions; don’t take sides.
- Chaotic Neutral: Follow whims; value personal freedom.
- Lawful Evil: Methodically take what you want within a code.
- Neutral Evil: Pursue desires untroubled by the harm caused.
- Chaotic Evil: Act with arbitrary violence driven by hatred or bloodlust.

Unaligned creatures (e.g., animals) don’t have alignments.
