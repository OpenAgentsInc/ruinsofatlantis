# Trinkets (1d100)

Roll 1d100 for a random trinket from the SRD list. Examples include a mummified goblin hand, a crystal that glows in moonlight, an indecipherable treasure map, and more (SRD pp.26â€“27).

For the complete list, see the SRD 5.2.1 PDF or integrate into your tooling from this repository later.
