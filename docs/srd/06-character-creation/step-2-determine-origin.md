# Step 2: Determine Origin

A character’s origin includes background and species. Your background influences your ability score increases (choose one listed ability to increase by 2 and a different one by 1, or increase all three by 1; none can exceed 20), grants a feat, and gives proficiencies (two skills and one tool). Your class also provides proficiencies and Proficiency Bonus (+2 at level 1).

- Choose a Species. Options include Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling, Human, Orc, and Tiefling. Record size and Speed.
- Imagine Your Past and Present. Consider formative events, relationships, and motivations.
- Choose Languages. You know Common plus two from the Standard Languages table; features may grant more. Rare languages exist and are available via features.

Standard Languages: Common, Common Sign Language, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Orc.

Rare Languages: Abyssal, Celestial, Deep Speech, Druidic, Infernal, Primordial (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, Terran), Sylvan, Thieves’ Cant, Undercommon.
