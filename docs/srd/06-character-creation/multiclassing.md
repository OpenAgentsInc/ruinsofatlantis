# Multiclassing

You can gain levels in multiple classes instead of advancing only in your current class.

- Prerequisites. You must have a score of at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class and your current classes.
- Experience Points. XP to gain a level is based on total character level.
- Hit Points and Hit Dice. Add HP per new level; pool Hit Dice per class (track different die types separately).
- Proficiency Bonus. Based on total character level.
- Proficiencies. When you take your first level in a new class, you gain only some starting proficiencies per class rules.
- Class Features. Gain features for levels you take in each class. Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting, and alternate AC calculations.
- Armor Class. If you have multiple ways to calculate AC, you benefit from only one at a time.
- Extra Attack. Extra Attack features donâ€™t stack.
- Spellcasting (Multiclass). Prepare spells separately per class; cantrips scale with total character level; determine shared spell slots using the Multiclass Spellcaster table (sum full caster levels + half paladin/ranger levels, rounded up) and use slots to cast any prepared spells you have.
- Pact Magic. Pact Magic slots (Warlock) and Spellcasting slots can be used interchangeably to cast prepared spells per rules.
