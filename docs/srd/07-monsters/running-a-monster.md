# Running a Monster

To ensure a monster acts in accordance with its Challenge Rating during combat:

- Special Abilities: Use powerful limited-use abilities as quickly and as often as possible.
- Multiattack: Use Multiattack on turns when not using more powerful abilities.
- Bonus Actions, Reactions, Legendary Actions: Use them as often as possible when available.

Ammunition: Monsters that require ammunition carry it.

Equipping Monsters: You may add gear; beware of impact on CR. Monsters can attune to items (see Equipment) as appropriate; a monster with a class tag counts as a member of that class for Attunement.
