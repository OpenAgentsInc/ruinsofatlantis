### Level 1: Spellcasting

As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See Spells for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list in this class.

- Cantrips. You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Light, Mage Hand, and Ray of Frost are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.
- Spellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship cultivated a spellbook containing the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice (Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Sleep, Thunderwave are recommended). When you gain Wizard levels after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook; each must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
- Spell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
- Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells available for you to cast from your spellbook. The number of prepared spells increases with your level (see the table). You can change your prepared list after a Long Rest.
- Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.
- Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

### Level 1: Ritual Adept

You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You must have the spell prepared unless it is already always prepared by another feature.

### Level 1: Arcane Recovery

Once per day when you finish a Short Rest, choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to or less than half your Wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher.

### Level 2: Scholar

Choose one skill in which you have proficiency from: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You gain Expertise in the chosen skill.

### Level 3: Wizard Subclass

You gain a Wizard subclass. The Evoker is included below. You gain additional subclass features at levels 6, 10, and 14.

### Level 5: Memorize Spell

When you finish a Short Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wizard spells you have prepared with another level 1+ spell from the book.

### Level 18: Spell Mastery

Choose a level 1 and a level 2 Wizard spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast each at its lowest level without expending a spell slot. Casting them at higher levels requires expending spell slots. You can change the chosen spells after a Long Rest.

### Level 20: Signature Spells

Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. After doing so, you can’t cast them in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Spellbook Rules

- Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s a level you can prepare. For each level of the spell, transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP.
- Copying the Book. You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book in 1 hour and 10 GP per spell level.
- Replacing a Lost Spellbook. You can transcribe your prepared Wizard spells into a new spellbook using the Copying the Book rules.

## Wizard Subclass: Evoker

Create Explosive Elemental Effects

Evokers specialize in magic that creates elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid.

### Level 10: Empowered Evocation

Add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of a Wizard spell you cast that deals damage.

### Level 14: Overchannel

When you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5 that deals damage, you can choose to deal maximum damage with that spell on the turn you cast it. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. Each subsequent time before you finish a Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage per level of the spell slot (this damage ignores Resistance and Immunity). Each further use before a Long Rest increases the Necrotic damage per spell level by 1d12.
