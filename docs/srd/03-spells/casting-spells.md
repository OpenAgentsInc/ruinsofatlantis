# Casting Spells

Each spell description has a series of entries that provide the spell’s details. The sections below explain how to read and use those entries, along with the rules for spell levels and spell slots.

## Spell Level

Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indicated in a spell’s description. A spell’s level is an indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips are level 0.

## Spell Slots

Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster’s magical potential is represented. Each spellcasting class gives a limited number of spell slots of certain levels. When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that spell’s level or higher. Finishing a Long Rest restores expended spell slots.

## Casting without Slots

- Cantrips. A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.
- Rituals. Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal and doesn’t expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Ritual, you must have it prepared.
- Special Abilities. Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as a limited number of uses per day.

## Spell Entries

Spell descriptions include some or all of the following entries:

- Casting Time. The time required to cast the spell (typically Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction). The spell specifies when you can cast it.
- Range. How far the spell reaches. Some spells have “Self” range; others target specified distances or areas.
- Components. The physical requirements for casting the spell: V (verbal), S (somatic), and M (material). If a Material component is consumed or has a cost, the spell says so. A Spellcasting Focus can substitute for non‑consumed, costless materials.
- Duration. How long the spell’s effects last. Some spells require Concentration to maintain; your Concentration can be broken under certain conditions (see “Rules Glossary”).
- Description. What the spell does at the time of casting and for its duration. If the spell can be cast with a higher‑level spell slot, the description explains how the spell’s effects change.
