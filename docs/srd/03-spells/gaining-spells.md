# Gaining Spells

Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell prepared in your mind or have access to the spell from a magic item, such as a Spell Scroll. Your features specify which spells you have access to, if any; whether you always have certain spells prepared; and whether you can change the list of spells you have prepared.

## Preparing Spells

If you have a list of level 1+ spells you prepare, your spellcasting feature specifies when you can change the list and the number of spells you can change, as summarized in the Spell Preparation by Class table.

### Spell Preparation by Class

| Class   | Change When You …        | Number of Spells |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Bard    | Gain a level              | One              |
| Cleric  | Finish a Long Rest        | Any              |
| Druid   | Finish a Long Rest        | Any              |
| Paladin | Finish a Long Rest        | One              |
| Ranger  | Finish a Long Rest        | One              |
| Sorcerer| Gain a level              | One              |
| Warlock | Gain a level              | One              |
| Wizard  | Finish a Long Rest        | Any              |

Most spellcasting monsters don’t change their lists of prepared spells, but the GM is free to alter them.

## Always‑Prepared Spells

Certain features might give you a spell that you always have prepared. If you also have a list of prepared spells that you can change, a spell that you always have prepared doesn’t count against the number of spells on that list.
