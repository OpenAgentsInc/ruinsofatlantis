# A Spells

## Acid Arrow
Level 2 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 90 feet
- Components: V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder’s stomach)
- Duration: Instantaneous

You create a magical arrow of acid that streaks toward a target you can see within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 Acid damage and 2d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage only.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2.

## Acid Splash
Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

You create an acidic bubble at a point within range, where it explodes in a 5‑foot‑radius Sphere. Each creature in that Sphere must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 Acid damage.

Cantrip Upgrade: The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17 (4d6).

## Aid
Level 2 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a strip of white cloth)
- Duration: 8 hours

Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target’s Hit Point maximum and current Hit Points increase by 5 for the duration.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: Each target’s Hit Points increase by 5 for each slot level above 2.

## Alarm
Level 1 Abjuration (Ranger, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a bell and silver wire)
- Duration: 8 hours

You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20‑foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, choose the kind of alarm—audible or mental.

The audible alarm produces the sound of a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet. A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area; the ping awakens you if you’re asleep.

## Alter Self
Level 2 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options. Its effects last for the duration; as a Magic action, you can replace the option with a different one.

- Aquatic Adaptation. You sprout gills and webbing; you can breathe underwater and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.
- Change Appearance. You alter your appearance (within your size and shape); you can’t change size category or basic shape. As a Magic action, you can change your appearance again.
- Natural Weapons. You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your Unarmed Strike to deal damage with this growth, it deals 1d6 of the type in parentheses instead of its normal damage, and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

## Animal Friendship
Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30 feet
