# V Spells

## Vampiric Touch
Level 3 Necromancy (Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your shadow‑wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain Hit Points equal to half the amount of Necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.

## Vicious Mockery
Enchantment Cantrip (Bard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V
- Duration: Instantaneous

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 Psychic damage and have Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

Cantrip Upgrade: The damage increases by 1d4 when you reach levels 5 (2d4), 11 (3d4), and 17 (4d4).

## Vitriolic Sphere
Level 4 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 150 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a drop of giant slug bile)
- Duration: Instantaneous

You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1‑foot‑diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20‑foot‑radius Sphere. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d4 Acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. A creature that failed the save also takes 5d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The initial damage increases by 2d4 and the delayed damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 4.
