# M Spells

## Mage Armor
Level 1 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)
- Duration: 8 hours

You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor. Until the spell ends, the target’s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends early if the target dons armor.

## Mage Hand
Conjuration Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: 1 minute

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. As a Magic action, you can move the hand up to 30 feet each time. The hand can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

## Major Image
Level 3 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20‑foot Cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects unless the spell says otherwise. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since objects can pass through it. As a Magic action, you can move the image to any other spot within range.

## Mass Healing Word
Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric)

- Casting Time: Bonus Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V

Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain Hit Points equal to 2d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3.

## Mass Suggestion
Level 6 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, M (a snake’s tongue)
- Duration: 24 hours (longer with higher‑level slots)

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be Charmed are immune. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. The spell ends for a target if the suggested activity is completed. Using a higher‑level slot increases the duration (10 days with a level 7 slot, 30 days with level 8, 366 days with level 9).

## Maze
Level 8 Conjuration (Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You banish a creature you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes by taking the Study action to make a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check on its turn. On a success, it escapes, and the spell ends.

## Mending
Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (two lodestones)
- Duration: Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin, provided the break is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension. The spell can physically repair a magic item, but it can’t restore magic to such an object.

## Message
Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: S, M (a copper wire)
- Duration: 1 round

You point toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear. You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal, or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.

- Range: 1 mile
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40‑foot‑radius Sphere centered on each point makes a Dexterity save, taking 20d6 Fire and 20d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. A creature in the area of more than one Sphere is affected only once. Unattended nonmagical objects in the area also take damage and may ignite.

## Mind Blank
Level 8 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: 24 hours

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has Immunity to Psychic damage and the Charmed condition. The target is also unaffected by effects that sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location. No spell—not even Wish—can gather information about the target.

## Minor Illusion
Illusion Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)

- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5‑foot‑radius, 40‑foot‑high Cylinder centered on a point within range. When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution save, taking 2d10 Radiant damage on a failed save (and shape‑changers revert) or half as much on a success. As a Magic action, you can move the Cylinder up to 60 feet. Using a higher‑level slot increases the damage by 1d10 per slot level above 2.

## Move Earth
Level 6 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a miniature shovel)

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration (raising/lowering ground, forming trenches, walls, pillars). Each change takes 10 minutes to complete and can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. Because the transformation occurs slowly, creatures aren’t usually trapped or injured by the movement.
