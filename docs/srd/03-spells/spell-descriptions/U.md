# U Spells

## Unseen Servant
Level 1 Conjuration (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)
- Duration: 1 hour

This spell creates an Invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space within range. It has AC 10, 1 Hit Point, and a Strength of 2, and it canâ€™t attack. If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends.

Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. It can perform simple tasks such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.
