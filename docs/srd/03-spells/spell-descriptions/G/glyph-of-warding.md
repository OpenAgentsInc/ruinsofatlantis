# Glyph of Warding
Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 hour
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth 200+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph. The glyph covers an area no larger than a 10‑foot square. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast the spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph can be triggered under conditions you describe when you cast the spell. You can choose either an explosive runes effect or a spell glyph effect as detailed in the spell’s description.
