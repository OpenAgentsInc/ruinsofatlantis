- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)

You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it’s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 Hit Points. While in this form, the target has a Fly Speed of 10 feet and can hover. It can enter and occupy the space of another creature. It has Resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has Advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. It can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can’t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can’t attack or cast spells.
