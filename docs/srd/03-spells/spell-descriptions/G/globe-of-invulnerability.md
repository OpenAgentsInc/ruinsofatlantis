# Globe of Invulnerability
Level 6 Abjuration (Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self (10‑foot radius)
- Components: V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10‑foot radius around you and remains for the duration. Any spell of level 5 or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher‑level slot. Such a spell has no effect on anything within the barrier. Spells of level 6+ can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell is interrupted when it passes through the barrier.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: If you cast this spell using a slot of level 7+, the barrier stops spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6.
