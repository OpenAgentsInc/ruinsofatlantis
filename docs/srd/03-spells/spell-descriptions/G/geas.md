Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V
- Duration: 30 days

You place a magical command on a creature you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the spell. While the creature is affected by the spell, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that canâ€™t be Charmed is immune to this spell. You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. You can end the spell early by taking a Magic action to dismiss it. Remove Curse, Greater Restoration, or Wish can also end this spell.
