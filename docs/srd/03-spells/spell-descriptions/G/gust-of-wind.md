- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self (60‑foot line)
- Components: V, S, M (a legume seed)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in the line’s direction. Any creature in the line moves at half Speed when it moves closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor, extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames, and causes protected flames to dance wildly.
