Level 4 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 150 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a drop of giant slug bile)
- Duration: Instantaneous

You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1‑foot‑diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20‑foot‑radius Sphere. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d4 Acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. A creature that failed the save also takes 5d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The initial damage increases by 2d4 and the delayed damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 4.
