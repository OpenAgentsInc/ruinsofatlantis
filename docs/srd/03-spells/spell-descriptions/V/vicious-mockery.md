Enchantment Cantrip (Bard)

- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 Psychic damage and have Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

Cantrip Upgrade: The damage increases by 1d4 when you reach levels 5 (2d4), 11 (3d4), and 17 (4d4).
