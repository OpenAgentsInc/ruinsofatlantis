# S Spells

## Sleep
Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a pinch of sand or rose petals)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature of your choice in a 5‑foot‑radius Sphere centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. On a second failure, the target has the Unconscious condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or if a creature within 5 feet takes an action to shake it awake. Creatures that don’t sleep or that have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition automatically succeed on the saves.

## Spiritual Weapon
Level 2 Evocation (Cleric)

- Casting Time: Bonus Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Create a floating, spectral weapon that you can move and strike with. When the spell appears, make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it; on a hit, it deals 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier Force damage. As a Bonus Action on later turns, move it up to 20 feet and repeat the attack. Using a higher‑level slot increases the damage by 1d8 per slot level above 2.

## Stone Shape
Level 4 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (soft clay)
- Duration: Instantaneous

Touch a Medium stone object or a section of stone up to 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape you like. Fine mechanical detail isn’t possible; an object can have up to two hinges and a latch.

## Stoneskin

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100+ GP, which the spell consumes)

## Storm of Vengeance
Level 9 Conjuration (Druid)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 1 mile
- Components: V, S

A 300‑foot‑radius storm cloud forms and unleashes a sequence of effects each round (Thunder/Deafened, Acid rain, Lightning bolts, Hailstones, and sustained Cold/wind effects) as detailed in the spell description.

## Suggestion
Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, M (a drop of honey)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours

You suggest a course of activity (no more than 25 words) to one creature that can hear and understand you. The suggestion must be worded to sound reasonable. On a failed Wisdom save, the target pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability until completed or the duration ends.

## Symbol
Level 7 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Until dispelled or triggered

Inscribe a powerful glyph on a surface or within a closable object. You define a trigger and choose an effect (Death, Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning). When triggered, creatures in the area save against the chosen effect as the glyph glows and fills a 60‑foot‑radius with Dim Light for 10 minutes. See the spell for full trigger options and effect details.
