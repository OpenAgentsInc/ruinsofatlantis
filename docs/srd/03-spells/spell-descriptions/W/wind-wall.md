# Wind Wall
Level 3 Evocation (Druid, Ranger)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is Opaque and lasts for the duration. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. Creatures in the wall’s area when it appears must make a Strength saving throw; on a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 Bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a success.
