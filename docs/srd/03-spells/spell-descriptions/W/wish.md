# Wish
Level 9 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V
- Duration: Instantaneous

Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. Alternatively, you can create nearly any effect, but the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. The GM decides what occurs in such an instance; repeated use beyond duplicating other spells can permanently weaken you and potentially remove your ability to cast Wish again.
