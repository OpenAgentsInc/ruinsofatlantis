# Wall of Stone
Level 5 Transmutation (Druid, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a small block of granite)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes (or permanent)

A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and composed of up to ten 10‑foot‑by‑10‑foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space, the creature can choose which side of the wall to be on. If the wall is created so that a creature would be enclosed within it, the creature can make a Dexterity save to move to the nearest space not enclosed by the wall. If you maintain Concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled.
