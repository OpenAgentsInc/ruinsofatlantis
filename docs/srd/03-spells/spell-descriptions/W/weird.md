Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory monstrosities from their nightmares visible only to them. Each creature in a 30â€‘foot radius makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is Frightened for the duration and takes 4d10 Psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
