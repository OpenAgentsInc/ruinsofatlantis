# Web
Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a bit of spider web)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20â€‘foot Cube from that point for the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain and Lightly Obscured. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity save. On a failed save, the creature is Restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. A creature Restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC; if it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.
