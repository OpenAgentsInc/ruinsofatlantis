# Darkness
Level 2 Evocation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Magical Darkness spreads from a point within range and fills a 15‑foot‑radius Sphere. Darkvision can’t see through it, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. Alternatively, you cast it on an object not worn or carried, causing Darkness in a 15‑foot Emanation from the object. Covering the object with something opaque blocks the Darkness. If any of this spell’s area overlaps with Bright or Dim Light from a spell of level 2 or lower, that spell is dispelled.
