Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any ongoing spell of level 3 or lower on the target ends. For each ongoing spell of level 4+ on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability (DC 10 + the spell’s level); on a success, that spell ends.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: You automatically end a spell on the target if the spell’s level is equal to or less than the level of the slot you use.
