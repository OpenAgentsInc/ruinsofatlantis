# Dispel Evil and Good
Level 5 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S, M (powdered silver and iron)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead have Disadvantage on attack rolls against you. You can end the spell early with one of two functions: Break Enchantment (touch a creature to end possession or Charmed/Frightened from such creatures) or Dismissal (as a Magic action, target a creature of those types within 5 feet; on a Charisma save failure, it returns to its origin plane and canâ€™t return for 24 hours by any means short of Wish).
