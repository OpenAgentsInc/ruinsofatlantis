Level 4 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 500 feet

- Duration: Instantaneous

You teleport to a location within range (a place you can see, visualize, or describe by distance and direction). You can also teleport a willing creature within 5 feet of you to a space within 5 feet of your destination. If any of you would arrive in an occupied space or a space filled with objects, each traveling creature takes 4d6 Force damage, and the teleportation fails.
