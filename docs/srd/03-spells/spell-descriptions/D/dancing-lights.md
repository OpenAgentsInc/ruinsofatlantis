# Dancing Lights
Evocation Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create up to four torch‑sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air. Each sheds Dim Light in a 10‑foot radius. As a Magic action, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of at least one other light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range. You can also combine the lights into a glowing, vaguely Humanoid form of Medium size that likewise gives off Dim Light in a 10‑foot radius.
