# Disguise Self
Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S
- Duration: 1 hour

You make yourself—including clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different. The changes fail to hold up to physical inspection (objects pass through apparent additions, etc.). To discern you are disguised, a creature must take the Study action and succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
