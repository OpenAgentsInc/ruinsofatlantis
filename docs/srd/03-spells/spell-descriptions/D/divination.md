Put yourself in contact with a god or god’s servants and ask one question about a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply (often a short phrase or cryptic rhyme). The spell doesn’t account for circumstances that might change the answer. Casting more than once before a Long Rest incurs a cumulative 25% chance after the first casting that you get no answer.
