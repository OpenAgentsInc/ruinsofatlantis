# D Spells

## Darkness
Level 2 Evocation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Magical Darkness spreads from a point within range and fills a 15‑foot‑radius Sphere. Darkvision can’t see through it, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. Alternatively, you cast it on an object not worn or carried, causing Darkness in a 15‑foot Emanation from the object. Covering the object with something opaque blocks the Darkness. If any of this spell’s area overlaps with Bright or Dim Light from a spell of level 2 or lower, that spell is dispelled.

## Darkvision
Level 2 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a dried carrot)
- Duration: 8 hours

For the duration, a willing creature you touch has Darkvision with a range of 150 feet.

## Daylight
Level 3 Evocation (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: 1 hour

Sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills a 60‑foot‑radius Sphere. The area is Bright Light and sheds Dim Light for an additional 60 feet. Alternatively, you cast it on an object not worn or carried, creating an Emanation as above.

## Detect Magic
Level 1 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action or Ritual
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you sense the presence of magical effects within 30 feet of yourself. If you sense such effects, you can take the Magic action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears the magic and, if created by a spell, learn the school of magic. Blocked by 1 foot of stone/wood/dirt, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.

## Detect Poison and Disease
Level 1 Divination (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)

- Casting Time: Action or Ritual
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S, M (a yew leaf)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you sense the location of poisons, poisonous or venomous creatures, and magical poisons within 30 feet of yourself. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease. Blocked by 1 foot of stone/wood/dirt, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.

## Dimension Door
Level 4 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 500 feet
- Components: V
- Duration: Instantaneous

You teleport to a location within range (a place you can see, visualize, or describe by distance and direction). You can also teleport a willing creature within 5 feet of you to a space within 5 feet of your destination. If any of you would arrive in an occupied space or a space filled with objects, each traveling creature takes 4d6 Force damage, and the teleportation fails.

## Disguise Self
Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S
- Duration: 1 hour

You make yourself—including clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different. The changes fail to hold up to physical inspection (objects pass through apparent additions, etc.). To discern you are disguised, a creature must take the Study action and succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

## Disintegrate
Level 6 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a lodestone and dust)
- Duration: Instantaneous

Launch a green ray at a target you can see within range (creature, nonmagical object, or creation of magical force). A creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 + 40 Force damage on a failed save. If this damage reduces the target to 0 Hit Points, it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying disintegrate into gray dust (revivable only by True Resurrection or Wish). A Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force is disintegrated; if Huge or larger, a 10‑foot cube portion is disintegrated.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6.

## Dispel Evil and Good
Level 5 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S, M (powdered silver and iron)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead have Disadvantage on attack rolls against you. You can end the spell early with one of two functions: Break Enchantment (touch a creature to end possession or Charmed/Frightened from such creatures) or Dismissal (as a Magic action, target a creature of those types within 5 feet; on a Charisma save failure, it returns to its origin plane and can’t return for 24 hours by any means short of Wish).

## Dispel Magic
Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any ongoing spell of level 3 or lower on the target ends. For each ongoing spell of level 4+ on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability (DC 10 + the spell’s level); on a success, that spell ends.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: You automatically end a spell on the target if the spell’s level is equal to or less than the level of the slot you use.

## Dissonant Whispers
Level 1 Enchantment (Bard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V
- Duration: Instantaneous

One creature of your choice that you can see within range hears a discordant melody. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Psychic damage and must immediately use its Reaction to move as far away from you as it can, using the safest route. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1.

## Divination
Level 4 Divination (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action or Ritual
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S, M (incense worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Instantaneous

Put yourself in contact with a god or god’s servants and ask one question about a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply (often a short phrase or cryptic rhyme). The spell doesn’t account for circumstances that might change the answer. Casting more than once before a Long Rest incurs a cumulative 25% chance after the first casting that you get no answer.
