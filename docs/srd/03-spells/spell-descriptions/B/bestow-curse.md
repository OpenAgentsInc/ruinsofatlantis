You touch a creature, which must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration. Until the curse ends, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice:
- Choose one ability. The target has Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability.
- The target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the Dodge action on that turn.
- If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra 1d8 Necrotic damage.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: With a level 4 slot, you can maintain Concentration for up to 10 minutes. With a level 5–6 slot, the spell doesn’t require Concentration and lasts 8 hours; with a level 7–8 slot, 24 hours; with a level 9 slot, until dispelled.
