# Black Tentacles
Level 4 Conjuration (Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 90 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a tentacle)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20â€‘foot square on ground you can see within range. For the duration, the ground in that area is Difficult Terrain. Each creature in the area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage and has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends its turn there (once per turn). A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on a success.
