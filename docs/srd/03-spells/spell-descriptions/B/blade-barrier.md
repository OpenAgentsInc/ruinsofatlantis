# Blade Barrier
Level 6 Evocation (Cleric)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 90 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of whirling magical blades. Make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides Three‑Quarters Cover, and its space is Difficult Terrain.

Any creature in the wall’s space makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. A creature also makes that save if it enters the wall’s space or ends its turn there (once per turn).
