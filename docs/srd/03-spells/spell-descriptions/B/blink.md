Level 3 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S
- Duration: 1 minute

Roll 1d6 at the end of each of your turns for the duration. On a 4â€“6, you vanish to the Ethereal Plane until the start of your next turn (or until the spell ends if you are already on that plane). While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see into your previous plane out to 60 feet but can affect only creatures there that also have a way to perceive or interact with the Ethereal. You return to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of where you left; if none is available, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space.
