# Blight
Level 4 Necromancy (Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

A creature you can see within range makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. A Plant creature automatically fails the save. Alternatively, target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature; it doesn’t make a save and simply withers and dies.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4.
