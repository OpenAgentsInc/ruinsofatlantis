## Fire Bolt
Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or an object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 Fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn’t being worn or carried.

Cantrip Upgrade: The damage increases by 1d10 when you reach levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10).

## Feather Fall

- Duration: 1 minute

Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature’s rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If a creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no damage from the fall, and the spell ends for that creature.

## Find Familiar
Level 1 Conjuration (Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 hour or Ritual
- Range: 10 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose. The familiar appears in an unoccupied space within range. It acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands and takes its turn on your Initiative. A familiar can’t attack.

While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. As a Magic action, you can see through its eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are Deafened and Blinded with respect to your own senses.

If the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss it to a pocket dimension or cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You can have only one familiar at a time. Casting this spell again while you have a familiar causes the familiar to adopt a new eligible form.
