# Illusory Script
Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a leadâ€‘based ink worth 10+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: 10 days

You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration. To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended. To all others, the writing appears as if written in an unknown or magical script, is unintelligible, or conveys an entirely different meaning (your choice). A creature with Truesight can read the hidden message. If the writing is physically altered, the illusion is broken.
