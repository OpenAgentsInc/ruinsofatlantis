Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place, shuffling, tapping, and capering. Creatures that canâ€™t be Charmed are immune. The target has Disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls, and other creatures have Advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing target can make a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself; on a success, the spell ends.
