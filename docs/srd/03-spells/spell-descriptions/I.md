# I Spells

## Identify
Level 1 Divination (Bard, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a pearl worth 100+ GP and an owl feather)
- Duration: Instantaneous

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic‑imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires Attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

Alternatively, you can target a creature throughout the casting. You learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting the creature.

## Illusory Script
Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a lead‑based ink worth 10+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: 10 days

You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration. To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended. To all others, the writing appears as if written in an unknown or magical script, is unintelligible, or conveys an entirely different meaning (your choice). A creature with Truesight can read the hidden message. If the writing is physically altered, the illusion is broken.

## Insect Plague
Level 5 Conjuration (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 300 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Swarming biting locusts fill a 20‑foot‑radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The Sphere spreads around corners. The area is Difficult Terrain and is Lightly Obscured. Each creature in the Sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much on a success.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5.

## Invisibility
Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

A creature you touch becomes Invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is Invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: You can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2.

## Irresistible Dance
Level 6 Enchantment (Bard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place, shuffling, tapping, and capering. Creatures that can’t be Charmed are immune. The target has Disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls, and other creatures have Advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing target can make a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself; on a success, the spell ends.
