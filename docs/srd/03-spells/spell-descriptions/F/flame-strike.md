A vertical column of brilliant fire roars down. Each creature in a 10‑foot‑radius, 40‑foot‑high Cylinder centered on a point within range makes a Dexterity save, taking 5d6 Fire and 5d6 Radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: Both damage types increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 5.
