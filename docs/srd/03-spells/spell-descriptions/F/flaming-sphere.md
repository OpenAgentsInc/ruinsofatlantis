# Flaming Sphere
Level 2 Conjuration (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a ball of wax)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 5‑foot‑diameter sphere of fire in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity save, taking 2d6 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. As a Bonus Action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you move it into a creature’s space, that creature makes the save, and the sphere stops moving for the turn.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2.
