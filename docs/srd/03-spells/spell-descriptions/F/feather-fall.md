# Feather Fall
Level 1 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Reaction (when you or a creature you see within 60 feet falls)
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, M (a small feather or piece of down)
- Duration: 1 minute

Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creatureâ€™s rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If a creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no damage from the fall, and the spell ends for that creature.
