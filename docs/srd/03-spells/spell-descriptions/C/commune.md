- Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S, M (incense)
- Duration: 1 minute

Contact a deity or divine proxy and ask up to three yes/no questions. You must ask before the spell ends. You receive correct answers; you might receive “unclear” if beyond the deity’s knowledge. If the one‑word answer could mislead, the GM may offer a brief phrase. Casting more than once before a Long Rest incurs a cumulative 25% chance after the first casting that you get no answer.
