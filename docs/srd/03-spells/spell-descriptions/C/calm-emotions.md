# Calm Emotions
Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each Humanoid in a 20‑foot‑radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects (choose for each creature):
- The creature has Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions until the spell ends (suppressing those conditions if already present).
- The creature becomes Indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is Hostile toward; this ends for a target if it takes damage or sees its allies take damage.
