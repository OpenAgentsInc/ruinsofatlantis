# Clairvoyance
Level 3 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: 1 mile
- Components: V, S, M (a focus worth 100+ GP, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an Invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door or around a corner). When you cast the spell, choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space and can switch senses as a Bonus Action. A creature that can see the sensor (e.g., via See Invisibility or Truesight) sees it as a luminous orb the size of your fist.
