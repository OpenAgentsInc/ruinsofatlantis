# Comprehend Languages
Level 1 Divination (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action or Ritual
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)
- Duration: 1 hour

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You can also understand written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text. The spell doesn’t decode secret messages in text or glyphs, such as an arcane sigil, that aren’t part of a written language.
