# Call Lightning
Level 3 Conjuration (Druid)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You call down a bolt of lightning from a storm cloud that appears in a 10‑foot‑high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in a 5‑foot‑radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action on subsequent turns to call down lightning again, targeting the same point or a different one. If you’re outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell takes control of the storm instead of creating one; under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3.
