# Clone
Level 8 Necromancy (Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 hour
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes, and a sealable vessel worth 2,000+ GP large enough to hold the creature)
- Duration: Instantaneous

You touch a creature or at least 1 cubic inch of its flesh. An inert duplicate forms inside the vessel and finishes growing after 120 days; you choose whether the clone is the same age as the original or younger. The clone remains inert and endures indefinitely while its vessel remains undisturbed. If the original creature dies after the clone finishes forming, its soul transfers to the clone if free and willing. The clone is physically identical and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original’s equipment. The original remains, if any, become inert and can’t be revived.
