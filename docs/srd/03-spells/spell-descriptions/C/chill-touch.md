# Chill Touch
Necromancy Cantrip (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: 1 round

You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Necrotic damage, and it canâ€™t regain Hit Points until the start of your next turn. If you hit an Undead target, it also has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.

Cantrip Upgrade: The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).
