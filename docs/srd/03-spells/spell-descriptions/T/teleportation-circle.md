# Teleportation Circle
Level 5 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: 10 feet
- Components: V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems worth 50+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: 1 round

As you cast the spell, you draw a 10‑foot‑diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know on the same plane of existence. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
