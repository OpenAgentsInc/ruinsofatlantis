- Range: 60 feet

You move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell and as a Magic action on later turns, target one creature or object you can see within range. A Huge or smaller creature makes a Strength save or you move it up to 30 feet (it is Restrained until the end of your next turn; if lifted, it is suspended). An unattended object moves automatically up to 30 feet; if worn or carried, its bearer makes a Strength save to resist.
