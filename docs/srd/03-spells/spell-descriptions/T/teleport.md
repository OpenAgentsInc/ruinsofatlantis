This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select.

Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully, as the spellâ€™s rules describe (Very Familiar to False Destination with associated mishap tables).
