Level 6 Necromancy (Cleric)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 Necromancy damage, and its Hit Point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a Long Rest. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its Hit Point maximum.
