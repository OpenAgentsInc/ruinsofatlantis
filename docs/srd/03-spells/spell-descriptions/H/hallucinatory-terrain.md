# Hallucinatory Terrain
Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Druid, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: 300 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)
- Duration: 24 hours

You make natural terrain in a 150‑foot Cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of terrain. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren’t changed in appearance. The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. A creature can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve the illusion.
