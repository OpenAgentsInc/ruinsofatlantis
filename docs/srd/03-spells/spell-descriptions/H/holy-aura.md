Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a protective aura. Creatures of your choice in a 30‑foot radius centered on you have Advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have Disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, a Fiend or Undead that hits an affected creature with a melee attack must make a Constitution saving throw or be Blinded until the spell ends.
