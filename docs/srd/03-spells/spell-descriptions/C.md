# C Spells

## Call Lightning
Level 3 Conjuration (Druid)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You call down a bolt of lightning from a storm cloud that appears in a 10‑foot‑high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in a 5‑foot‑radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action on subsequent turns to call down lightning again, targeting the same point or a different one. If you’re outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell takes control of the storm instead of creating one; under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3.

## Calm Emotions
Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each Humanoid in a 20‑foot‑radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects (choose for each creature):
- The creature has Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions until the spell ends (suppressing those conditions if already present).
- The creature becomes Indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is Hostile toward; this ends for a target if it takes damage or sees its allies take damage.

## Chromatic Orb
Level 1 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 90 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth 50+ GP)
- Duration: Instantaneous

Hurl an orb of energy at a target within range. Choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder for the damage type, then make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 damage of the chosen type. If you roll the same number on two or more d8s, the orb leaps to a different target of your choice within 30 feet of the original target and deals 2d8 damage of the chosen type to that target.

## Clairvoyance
Level 3 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: 1 mile
- Components: V, S, M (a focus worth 100+ GP, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an Invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door or around a corner). When you cast the spell, choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space and can switch senses as a Bonus Action. A creature that can see the sensor (e.g., via See Invisibility or Truesight) sees it as a luminous orb the size of your fist.

## Clone
Level 8 Necromancy (Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 hour
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes, and a sealable vessel worth 2,000+ GP large enough to hold the creature)
- Duration: Instantaneous

You touch a creature or at least 1 cubic inch of its flesh. An inert duplicate forms inside the vessel and finishes growing after 120 days; you choose whether the clone is the same age as the original or younger. The clone remains inert and endures indefinitely while its vessel remains undisturbed. If the original creature dies after the clone finishes forming, its soul transfers to the clone if free and willing. The clone is physically identical and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original’s equipment. The original remains, if any, become inert and can’t be revived.

## Cloudkill
Level 5 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a 20‑foot‑radius Sphere of yellow‑green fog centered on a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is Heavily Obscured. Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d8 Poison damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there (once per turn). The Sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5.

## Color Spray
Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S, M (a pinch of colorful sand)
- Duration: Instantaneous

You launch a dazzling array of flashing, colorful light. Each creature in a 15‑foot Cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition until the end of your next turn.

## Command
Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V
- Duration: Instantaneous

Speak a one‑word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom save or follow the command on its next turn. Choose from: Approach, Drop, Flee, Grovel, or Halt. Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: Affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1.

## Commune
Level 5 Divination (Cleric)

- Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S, M (incense)
- Duration: 1 minute

Contact a deity or divine proxy and ask up to three yes/no questions. You must ask before the spell ends. You receive correct answers; you might receive “unclear” if beyond the deity’s knowledge. If the one‑word answer could mislead, the GM may offer a brief phrase. Casting more than once before a Long Rest incurs a cumulative 25% chance after the first casting that you get no answer.

## Commune with Nature
Level 5 Divination (Druid, Ranger)

- Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

You gain knowledge of the surrounding area: outdoors within 3 miles; natural underground within 300 feet; not in constructed areas (e.g., castles). Choose three facts to learn: locations of settlements; locations of portals; location of one CR 10+ creature of specified types (GM’s choice); most prevalent plant, mineral, or Beast; locations of bodies of water.

## Comprehend Languages
Level 1 Divination (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action or Ritual
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)
- Duration: 1 hour

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You can also understand written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text. The spell doesn’t decode secret messages in text or glyphs, such as an arcane sigil, that aren’t part of a written language.

## Cone of Cold
Level 5 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self (60‑foot Cone)
- Components: V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)
- Duration: Instantaneous

A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60‑foot Cone makes a Constitution save, taking 8d8 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5.

## Confusion
Level 4 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 90 feet
- Components: V, S, M (three nut shells)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature in a 10‑foot‑radius Sphere centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected. An affected target can’t take Bonus Actions or Reactions and must roll 1d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn. See the spell’s behavior table for details. A target can make a Wisdom save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
