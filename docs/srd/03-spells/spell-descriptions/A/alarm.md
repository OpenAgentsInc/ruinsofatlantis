# Alarm
Level 1 Abjuration (Ranger, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a bell and silver wire)
- Duration: 8 hours

You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20‑foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, choose the kind of alarm—audible or mental.

The audible alarm produces the sound of a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet. A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area; the ping awakens you if you’re asleep.
