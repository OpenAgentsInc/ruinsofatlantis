You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options. Its effects last for the duration; as a Magic action, you can replace the option with a different one.

- Aquatic Adaptation. You sprout gills and webbing; you can breathe underwater and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.
- Change Appearance. You alter your appearance (within your size and shape); you canâ€™t change size category or basic shape. As a Magic action, you can change your appearance again.
- Natural Weapons. You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning).
