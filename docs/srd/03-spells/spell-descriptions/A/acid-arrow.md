Level 2 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 90 feet
- Components: V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder’s stomach)
- Duration: Instantaneous

You create a magical arrow of acid that streaks toward a target you can see within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 Acid damage and 2d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage only.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2.
