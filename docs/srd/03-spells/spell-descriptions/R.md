- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a prayer wheel)
- Duration: 1 hour

A creature you touch regains 4d8 + 15 Hit Points. For the duration, the target regains 1 Hit Point at the start of each of its turns, and any severed body parts regrow after 2 minutes.

Level 5 Necromancy (Druid)

- Casting Time: 1 hour

You touch a dead Humanoid or a piece of one. If the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new body for it and calls the soul to enter that body. Roll on the spell’s species table (or the GM chooses another playable species) to determine the body’s species. The revived creature is Friendly to you. See the spell for the full species table and details.
