You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon no larger than a 15‑foot Cube. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion. As a Magic action, you can cause the image to move to any other spot within range.
