Level 7 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Until dispelled or triggered

Inscribe a powerful glyph on a surface or within a closable object. You define a trigger and choose an effect (Death, Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning). When triggered, creatures in the area save against the chosen effect as the glyph glows and fills a 60‑foot‑radius with Dim Light for 10 minutes. See the spell for full trigger options and effect details.
