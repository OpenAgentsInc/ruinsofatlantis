# Sleep
Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a pinch of sand or rose petals)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature of your choice in a 5‑foot‑radius Sphere centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. On a second failure, the target has the Unconscious condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or if a creature within 5 feet takes an action to shake it awake. Creatures that don’t sleep or that have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition automatically succeed on the saves.
