# Speak with Dead
Level 3 Necromancy (Bard, Cleric)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 10 feet
- Components: V, S, M (burning incense)
- Duration: 10 minutes

You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and canâ€™t be Undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days. Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew, and it answers as briefly as possible, cryptically, or truthfully.
