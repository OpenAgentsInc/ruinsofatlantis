- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self (15‑foot radius)
- Components: V, S, M (a holy symbol)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. When you cast the spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature’s Speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 3d8 Radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or Necrotic damage (if you are evil). Affected creatures make a Wisdom save for half damage.
