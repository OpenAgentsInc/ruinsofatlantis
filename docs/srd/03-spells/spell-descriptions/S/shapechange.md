You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be any creature with a Challenge Rating equal to or less than your level. Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, but you retain your alignment and personality. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creatureâ€™s bonus instead. You can change form as a Bonus Action on subsequent turns.
