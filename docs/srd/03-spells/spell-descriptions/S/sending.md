- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Unlimited
- Components: V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)
- Duration: 1 round

You send a short message of twenty‑five words or fewer to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind and can answer in a like manner immediately. The message can travel to another plane of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn’t arrive.
