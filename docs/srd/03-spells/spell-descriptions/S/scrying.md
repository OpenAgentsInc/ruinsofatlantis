You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. On a failed save, the spell creates an Invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target; you can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. A creature that can see Invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.
