Name or describe a famous person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about that famous thing, as described by the GM. The lore might include important details, amusing revelations, or even secret lore. The more information you already know, the more precise and detailed the information. It is accurate but may be couched in figurative language or poetry. If the subject isnâ€™t actually famous, the spell fails.
