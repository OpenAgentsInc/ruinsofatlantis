One creature or loose object you can see within range rises vertically up to 20 feet and remains suspended there for the duration. The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. A creature can also move by making a successful Strength (Athletics) check.
