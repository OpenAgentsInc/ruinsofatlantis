# E Spells

## Enhance Ability
Level 2 Transmutation (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (fur or feather from a beast)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You touch a willing creature and bestow a magical enhancement. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains the listed benefit for the duration:
- Bear’s Endurance (Constitution): Advantage on Constitution checks; it also gains 2d6 Temporary Hit Points, which are lost when the spell ends.
- Bull’s Strength (Strength): Advantage on Strength checks; the target’s carrying capacity doubles.
- Cat’s Grace (Dexterity): Advantage on Dexterity checks; the target doesn’t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t Incapacitated.
- Eagle’s Splendor (Charisma): Advantage on Charisma checks.
- Fox’s Cunning (Intelligence): Advantage on Intelligence checks.
- Owl’s Wisdom (Wisdom): Advantage on Wisdom checks.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: You can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2.

## Enlarge/Reduce
Level 2 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose a creature or an object that isn’t being worn or carried. If the target is unwilling, it makes a Constitution saving throw; on a success, the spell has no effect.
- Enlarge: The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category (e.g., from Medium to Large). If there isn’t enough room, the target’s size doesn’t change. The target has Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.
- Reduce: The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one‑eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category. The target has Disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also shrink; its attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (to a minimum of 1).

## Enthrall
Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Warlock)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: 1 minute

You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can’t be Charmed succeeds automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you.

## Eyebite
Level 6 Necromancy (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread power. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you and choose one of the following effects; the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends on that target.
- Asleep: The target falls Unconscious. It awakens if it takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it awake.
- Panicked: The target has the Frightened condition. On each of its turns, the Frightened target must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route unless there is nowhere to move. If the target ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect.
- Sickened: The target has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect.
