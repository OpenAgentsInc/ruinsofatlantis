- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create an illusory manifestation of a creature’s deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d10 Psychic damage and has Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half damage only, and the spell ends. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns; on a failure, it takes the damage again, and on a success, the spell ends. Using a higher‑level slot increases the damage by 1d10 per slot level above 4.
