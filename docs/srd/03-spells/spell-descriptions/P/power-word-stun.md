# Power Word Stun
Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Duration: Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it Stunned. If the target has 150 Hit Points or fewer, it is Stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. At the end of each of its turns, the Stunned target makes a Constitution saving throw; on a success, the spell ends.
