# Protection from Evil and Good
Level 1 Abjuration (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a flask of Holy Water worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead. The protection grants several benefits: creatures of those types have Disadvantage on attack rolls against the target; the target canâ€™t be Charmed, Frightened, or possessed by them; and if the target is already affected, it has Advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
