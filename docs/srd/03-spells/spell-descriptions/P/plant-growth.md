You channel vitality into plants within a 100‑foot radius centered on a point within range. Overgrowth: On land in range, plants grow thick and overgrown; a creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every foot moved. Enrichment: You enliven the land; all plants in a half‑mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for one year, yielding twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
