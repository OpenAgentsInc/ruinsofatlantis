# W Spells

## Wall of Fire
Level 4 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make a straight wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is Opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast the spell, deals 5d8 Fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature that moves through the wall takes the damage once per turn.

## Wall of Stone
Level 5 Transmutation (Druid, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a small block of granite)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes (or permanent)

A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and composed of up to ten 10‑foot‑by‑10‑foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space, the creature can choose which side of the wall to be on. If the wall is created so that a creature would be enclosed within it, the creature can make a Dexterity save to move to the nearest space not enclosed by the wall. If you maintain Concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled.

## Water Breathing
Level 3 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 action or Ritual
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)
- Duration: 24 hours

This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.

## Water Walk
Level 3 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Ranger)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a piece of cork)
- Duration: 1 hour

This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground.

## Web
Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a bit of spider web)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20‑foot Cube from that point for the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain and Lightly Obscured. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity save. On a failed save, the creature is Restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. A creature Restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC; if it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.

## Weird
Level 9 Illusion (Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory monstrosities from their nightmares visible only to them. Each creature in a 30‑foot radius makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is Frightened for the duration and takes 4d10 Psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

## Wish
Level 9 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Components: V
- Duration: Instantaneous

Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. Alternatively, you can create nearly any effect, but the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. The GM decides what occurs in such an instance; repeated use beyond duplicating other spells can permanently weaken you and potentially remove your ability to cast Wish again.

## Wind Wall
Level 3 Evocation (Druid, Ranger)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is Opaque and lasts for the duration. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. Creatures in the wall’s area when it appears must make a Strength saving throw; on a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 Bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a success.
