# G Spells

## Gaseous Form
Level 3 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it’s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 Hit Points. While in this form, the target has a Fly Speed of 10 feet and can hover. It can enter and occupy the space of another creature. It has Resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has Advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. It can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can’t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can’t attack or cast spells.

## Geas
Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V
- Duration: 30 days

You place a magical command on a creature you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the spell. While the creature is affected by the spell, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t be Charmed is immune to this spell. You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. You can end the spell early by taking a Magic action to dismiss it. Remove Curse, Greater Restoration, or Wish can also end this spell.

## Globe of Invulnerability
Level 6 Abjuration (Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self (10‑foot radius)
- Components: V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10‑foot radius around you and remains for the duration. Any spell of level 5 or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher‑level slot. Such a spell has no effect on anything within the barrier. Spells of level 6+ can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell is interrupted when it passes through the barrier.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: If you cast this spell using a slot of level 7+, the barrier stops spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6.

## Glyph of Warding
Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 1 hour
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth 200+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph. The glyph covers an area no larger than a 10‑foot square. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast the spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph can be triggered under conditions you describe when you cast the spell. You can choose either an explosive runes effect or a spell glyph effect as detailed in the spell’s description.

## Grease
Level 1 Conjuration (Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)
- Duration: 1 minute

Slick grease covers the ground in a 10‑foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into Difficult Terrain for the duration. When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall Prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall Prone.

## Greater Invisibility
Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You or a creature you touch becomes Invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is Invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

## Greater Restoration
Level 5 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Instantaneous

You imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a debilitating effect. You can reduce the target’s Exhaustion level by one, end one of the following effects on the target: a Charmed or Petrified condition, a curse (including attunement to a cursed magic item), any reduction to one ability score, or one effect reducing the target’s Hit Point maximum.

## Guards and Wards
Level 6 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (burning incense, a small amount of diamond dust, and other components worth 10+ GP)
- Duration: 24 hours

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area equal to fifty 10‑foot squares or twenty‑five 10‑foot squares that are contiguous). You can shape the warded area as you like. The spell creates several effects, such as corridors filled with fog, doors sealed with Arcane Lock, stinking clouds, web‑filled stairs, and more as detailed in the spell’s description.

## Guiding Bolt
Level 1 Evocation (Cleric)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

A flash of light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 Radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has Advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.

## Gust of Wind
Level 2 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self (60‑foot line)
- Components: V, S, M (a legume seed)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in the line’s direction. Any creature in the line moves at half Speed when it moves closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor, extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames, and causes protected flames to dance wildly.
