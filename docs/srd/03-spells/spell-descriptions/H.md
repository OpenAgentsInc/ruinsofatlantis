# H Spells

## Hallow
Level 5 Abjuration (Cleric)

- Casting Time: 24 hours
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Until dispelled

You touch a point and infuse an area with holy (or unholy) power. The area can be a Sphere with a radius up to 60 feet. The spell affects the area until it is dispelled. When you cast the spell, you can set additional effects, such as creatures of a specified type having Disadvantage on Charisma checks while in the area or preventing such creatures from entering the area. You can also link a spell to the area, such as Daylight or Tongues, as detailed in the spell’s description.

## Hallucinatory Terrain
Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Druid, Wizard)

- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: 300 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)
- Duration: 24 hours

You make natural terrain in a 150‑foot Cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of terrain. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren’t changed in appearance. The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. A creature can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve the illusion.

## Harm
Level 6 Necromancy (Cleric)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 Necromancy damage, and its Hit Point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a Long Rest. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its Hit Point maximum.

## Haste
Level 3 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target’s Speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has Advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. When the spell ends, the target can’t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

## Heal
Level 6 Abjuration (Cleric, Druid)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

Choose a creature you can see within range. A surge of positive energy washes through the creature, causing it to regain 70 Hit Points. The spell also ends Blindness, Deafness, and any diseases affecting the target. This spell has no effect on Constructs or Undead.

## Heat Metal
Level 2 Transmutation (Bard, Druid)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red‑hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 Fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again. If a creature is wearing or holding the object and takes the damage, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

Using a Higher‑Level Spell Slot: The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2.

## Heroism

A willing creature you touch is imbued with bravery.

When the spell ends, the target loses any remaining Temporary Hit Points from it.

## Hold Monster

- Range: Self (30‑foot radius)
- Components: V, S, M (a vial of holy water)

Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a protective aura. Creatures of your choice in a 30‑foot radius centered on you have Advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have Disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, a Fiend or Undead that hits an affected creature with a melee attack must make a Constitution saving throw or be Blinded until the spell ends.
