# Mind Blank

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has Immunity to Psychic damage and the Charmed condition. The target is also unaffected by effects that sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location. No spell—not even Wish—can gather information about the target.
