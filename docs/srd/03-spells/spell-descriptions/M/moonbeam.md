# Moonbeam
Level 2 Evocation (Druid)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a moonseed leaf)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5‑foot‑radius, 40‑foot‑high Cylinder centered on a point within range. When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution save, taking 2d10 Radiant damage on a failed save (and shape‑changers revert) or half as much on a success. As a Magic action, you can move the Cylinder up to 60 feet. Using a higher‑level slot increases the damage by 1d10 per slot level above 2.
