Level 3 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20‑foot Cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects unless the spell says otherwise. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since objects can pass through it. As a Magic action, you can move the image to any other spot within range.
