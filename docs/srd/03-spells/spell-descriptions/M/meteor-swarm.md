- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40‑foot‑radius Sphere centered on each point makes a Dexterity save, taking 20d6 Fire and 20d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. A creature in the area of more than one Sphere is affected only once. Unattended nonmagical objects in the area also take damage and may ignite.
