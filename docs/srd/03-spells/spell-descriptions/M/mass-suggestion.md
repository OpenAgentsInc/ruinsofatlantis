# Mass Suggestion
Level 6 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: V, M (a snake’s tongue)
- Duration: 24 hours (longer with higher‑level slots)

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be Charmed are immune. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. The spell ends for a target if the suggested activity is completed. Using a higher‑level slot increases the duration (10 days with a level 7 slot, 30 days with level 8, 366 days with level 9).
