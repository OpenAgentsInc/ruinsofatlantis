# Combat

Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat often breaks out.

## The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side is defeated.

### Combat Step by Step

1. Establish Positions. The GM determines where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are—how far away and in what direction.
2. Roll Initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.
3. Take Turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat this step until the fighting stops.

### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check that determines their place in the Initiative order. The GM rolls for monsters. For a group of identical creatures, the GM makes a single roll, so each member of the group has the same Initiative.

- Surprise. If a combatant is surprised by combat starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their Initiative roll.

### Your Turn

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your Speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first.

- Communicating. You can communicate however you are able—through brief utterances and gestures—as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither your action nor your move. Extended communication requires an action (typically the Influence action).
- Interacting with Things. You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or action. Interacting with a second object requires the Utilize action. Some items always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.
- Doing Nothing. You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If undecided, consider Dodge or Ready.
- Ending Combat. Combat ends when one side is defeated, surrenders, flees, or both sides agree to end it.

## Movement and Position

On your turn, you can move a distance equal to your Speed or less—or not move at all. Movement can include climbing, crawling, jumping, and swimming. Deduct the distance of each part of your move from your Speed until used up or you stop.

- Speed. A character’s Speed is set during character creation; a monster’s Speed appears in its stat block. Special speeds (Climb, Fly, Swim) are in “Rules Glossary.”
- Difficult Terrain. Each foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs 1 extra foot (even if multiple effects make a space difficult).
- Breaking Up Your Move. You can move, take actions/Bonus Actions/Reactions, and move again.
- Dropping Prone. On your turn, you can give yourself the Prone condition without using an action or Speed; you can’t do so if your Speed is 0.
- Creature Size and Space. See table below.

### Creature Size and Space

| Size       | Space (Feet)  | Space (Squares) |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ feet  | 4 per square    |
| Small      | 5 by 5 feet    | 1 square        |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 feet    | 1 square        |
| Large      | 10 by 10 feet  | 4 squares (2×2) |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 feet  | 9 squares (3×3) |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 feet  | 16 squares (4×4) |

### Moving around Other Creatures

During your move, you can pass through the space of an ally, a creature that has the Incapacitated condition, a Tiny creature, or a creature that is two sizes larger or smaller than you. Another creature’s space is Difficult Terrain for you unless that creature is Tiny or your ally. You can’t willingly end your move in another creature’s space (with exceptions noted).

### Playing on a Grid

- Squares. Each square represents 5 feet.
- Speed. Convert Speed to squares by dividing by 5.
- Entering a Square. Costs 1 square (more if difficult or other effects apply).

## Making an Attack

When you take the Attack action, you make an attack. Some other actions, Bonus Actions, and Reactions also let you make an attack.

1. Choose a Target. Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. Determine Modifiers. The GM determines whether the target has Cover and whether you have Advantage or Disadvantage. Other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. Resolve the Attack. Make the attack roll. On a hit, roll damage unless the attack specifies otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

### Unseen Attackers and Targets

When you make an attack roll against a target you can’t see, you have Disadvantage on the roll. When a creature can’t see you, you have Advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden when you make an attack roll, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

### Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover, making a target more difficult to harm. A target benefits from cover only when an attack or effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. If multiple sources of cover apply, use only the most protective degree.

| Degree       | Benefit to Target              | Offered By …                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Half         | +2 bonus to AC and Dex saves   | Another creature or an object covering ≥ half |
| Three-Quarters | +5 bonus to AC and Dex saves | An object covering ≥ three-quarters        |
| Total        | Can’t be targeted directly     | An object covering the whole target        |

### Ranged Attacks

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack has a single range, you can’t attack beyond it. Some ranged attacks have two ranges: normal and long. Attack rolls beyond normal range have Disadvantage; you can’t attack beyond long range.

Ranged Attacks in Close Combat. When you make a ranged attack while within 5 feet of an enemy who can see you and isn’t Incapacitated, you have Disadvantage on the roll.

### Melee Attacks and Reach

A melee attack allows you to attack a target within your reach, typically using a hand‑held weapon or an Unarmed Strike. Most creatures have a 5‑foot reach; some have greater reach as noted.

### Opportunity Attacks

You can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature you can see leaves your reach. Take a Reaction to make one melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike against that creature, occurring just before it leaves your reach.

Avoiding Opportunity Attacks. You don’t provoke if you take Disengage, if you Teleport, or if something moves you without using your movement, action, Bonus Action, or Reaction.

## Mounted Combat

A willing creature at least one size larger than a rider and with appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount.

- Mounting and Dismounting. During your move, mount or dismount a creature within 5 feet by spending movement equal to half your Speed (round down).
- Controlling a Mount. You can control a mount trained to accept a rider. Its Initiative changes to match yours when you mount it. On your turn, it can take only Dash, Disengage, or Dodge.
- Independent Mount. A mount that isn’t controlled keeps its own Initiative and acts as it likes.
- Falling Off. If something would move your mount against its will while you’re on it, succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity save or fall Prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet. Make the same save if you or the mount are knocked Prone.

## Underwater Combat

- Impeded Weapons. Melee attack rolls with a weapon have Disadvantage unless the weapon deals Piercing damage, if you lack a Swim Speed.
- Ranged Attacks. Automatically miss beyond normal range; within normal range, attack rolls have Disadvantage.
- Fire Resistance. Anything underwater has Resistance to Fire damage.

## Damage and Healing

Injury and death are frequent threats.

### Hit Points

Hit Points represent durability and will to live. Hit Point maximum is the number you have when uninjured; current Hit Points range from that maximum down to 0. Subtract damage from current Hit Points. At half Hit Points or fewer, you are Bloodied (no inherent effect, but other effects may reference it).

### Damage Rolls

Roll the damage dice, add modifiers, and apply to the target. With weapon attacks, add the same ability modifier used for the attack roll to the damage roll. Spells specify their damage dice and modifiers. Fixed damage (no roll) doesn’t add your ability modifier unless a rule says otherwise.

### Critical Hits

On a Critical Hit, roll the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together (plus modifiers). Roll any additional damage dice (such as Sneak Attack) twice as well.

### Saving Throws and Damage

When multiple targets make saves against the same damaging effect at the same time, roll the damage once for all targets. Many effects deal half damage on a success (round down) equal to half the failed‑save damage.

### Damage Types; Resistance, Vulnerability, Immunity

Each damage instance has a type (Fire, Slashing, etc.).

- Resistance halves damage of that type (round down).
- Vulnerability doubles damage of that type.
- Multiple instances of Resistance or Vulnerability to the same damage type don’t stack; apply only one.
- Order of Application: apply bonuses/penalties/multipliers first; then Resistance; then Vulnerability.
- Immunity to a damage type means you take none of that type; Immunity to a condition means you aren’t affected by it.

### Resting

Short Rests (1 hour) and Long Rests (8 hours) restore resources; see “Rules Glossary.” Regaining Hit Points is a primary benefit of rests.

### Healing

Hit Points can be restored by magic (e.g., Cure Wounds, Potion of Healing) or by rests. When you receive healing, add the restored Hit Points to your current total, up to your maximum; excess is lost.

Knocking Out a Creature. When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee attack, you can instead reduce it to 1 Hit Point and give it the Unconscious condition. It then starts a Short Rest (ending the condition at the end of that rest or earlier if it regains any Hit Points or receives DC 10 Wisdom [Medicine] first aid).

### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 Hit Points, you either die outright or fall Unconscious.

Instant Death. A monster dies at 0 Hit Points (at GM discretion, a monster can be treated like a character). A creature dies if its Hit Point maximum reaches 0. Massive Damage: If damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points and the remainder equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.

Character Demise. If your character dies, magical revival might be possible (e.g., Raise Dead), or you can create a new character.

### Death Saving Throws

When you start your turn with 0 Hit Points, make a Death Saving Throw (not tied to an ability score):

- Three Successes/Failures. Roll 1d20; 10+ is a success, otherwise a failure. On three successes, you become Stable; on three failures, you die. The counts reset when you regain any Hit Points or become Stable.
- Rolling a 1 or 20. A 1 counts as two failures; a 20 restores 1 Hit Point.
- Damage at 0 Hit Points. Taking any damage is one failure; a Critical Hit is two. If the damage equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.

### Stabilizing a Character

Take the Help action and succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to stabilize a creature at 0 Hit Points. A Stable creature doesn’t make Death Saving Throws but remains Unconscious. Taking damage ends Stable and resumes Death Saves. A Stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours.

### Temporary Hit Points

Some effects grant Temporary Hit Points, a buffer against losing actual Hit Points.

- Lose Temporary Hit Points First. Damage removes Temporary Hit Points first; leftover damage applies to Hit Points.
- Duration. Temporary Hit Points last until depleted or until you finish a Long Rest.
- They Don’t Stack. If you receive more Temporary Hit Points, choose to keep the old amount or the new amount; they don’t add together.
- They’re Not Hit Points or Healing. You can be at full Hit Points and still have Temporary Hit Points. Receiving Temporary Hit Points isn’t healing and can’t restore consciousness at 0 Hit Points.
