Here’s a careful reconstruction of Fevir’s “MMOs Suck Now ► WoW Broke MMORPGs” thesis, built from contemporaneous discussion threads and persistent community talking points from the time. It’s not a transcript (the upload appears gone), but it captures the arguments people attributed to the video and the debate it sparked.

# The core claim

**World of Warcraft’s success standardized the genre’s design, and that standardization hollowed out the “massively” and “role-playing” parts of MMORPGs.** Instead of virtual worlds with social texture, discovery, and interdependence, most big releases converged on a safe, efficient “theme-park” loop optimized for queues, instanced content, and an endgame treadmill. The result: MMOs feel more like lobby games than worlds. ([Reddit][1])

---

## 1) The “WoW template” and design lock-in

* **Homogenization.** After WoW, publishers chased the same formula—quest hubs, linear leveling, hotbar combat, holy-trinity roles, raid/endgame treadmill—because it was legible to investors and broadly marketable. This crowded out weirder, riskier designs. Many in the 2015–2017 threads summarized the moment as “it’s the same formula over and over again.” ([Reddit][1])
* **Risk aversion.** Innovative MMOs that deviated from the template often launched underfunded or half-baked, which reinforced the industry’s “don’t experiment” reflex—feeding the very stagnation players were complaining about. ([Reddit][1])

**Why it matters:** When your first few hours in “a new MMO” feel interchangeable with the last five you tried, you stop forming attachments—to mechanics, locations, or people. That erodes the social glue that defined earlier worlds.

---

## 2) Convenience systems eroded server identity

* **Cross-realm and automated matchmaking (LFD/LFR).** Tools meant to reduce friction also dissolved realm culture: you group with strangers you’ll never meet again, hop shards without noticing, and your reputation is mostly irrelevant. The upside—instant groups—came at the cost of persistent social ties. Community posts from then to now keep returning to this point. ([Blizzard Watch][2])
* **Queue-centric play.** Many modern MMOs channel you into anonymous queues for dungeons/raids/PvP; you rarely see the same face twice. That feels like an **online game**, not a **massively multiplayer role-playing** world. ([Reddit][3])

**Why it matters:** If nothing in the world depends on who you are, where you’re from (your server), or who you know, then “massively” collapses into “matchmade.” The stakes of being a good (or bad) citizen vanish.

---

## 3) Leveling became a solo corridor; “the real game is endgame”

* **Solo smoothness over social friction.** To broaden appeal, studios made leveling fast, forgiving, and largely soloable. Older players argued that this removes the RPG arc (hard choices, class interdependence, downtime that fosters chat). Debates at the time pit “leveling is core RPG play” against “leveling is cardboard targets before the real multiplayer.” Both sides showed up in the Fevir threads. ([Reddit][1])
* **Endgame treadmill.** Power is stacked vertically: ilvl climbs, tiers reset, yesterday’s content becomes obsolete. This compresses the social graph at cap and trivializes the journey, pushing everyone into the same narrow slice of instanced content. ([Reddit][1])

**Why it matters:** When the only meaningful play is queued endgame, the world itself loses value; most of its geography, stories, and professions become transient tutorials.

---

## 4) Instancing and phasing weakened the “world”

* **Instanced solutions to design problems.** Instancing solved griefing, load, and balance issues—but at scale it also gutted open-world encounters, factional rivalries, and emergent drama. You don’t fight over spawns or dungeons if everyone has a private copy. Even supporters admit this trades world persistence for predictability. ([Reddit][1])

**Why it matters:** The memorable MMO stories—server firsts, open-world wars, social rescues—depend on shared space and scarcity.

---

## 5) Monetization and externalization chipped at immersion

* **Cash shops & shortcuts.** The F2P era introduced boosts, convenience items, cosmetics monetization—often fine individually, but together they can push design toward engagement loops that feel grindy or transactional. Contemporary comments cited “grind or pay” vibes across the genre. ([Reddit][4])
* **Out-of-game optimization (wikis, DPS meters, Discord).** Knowledge centralization and meta-solving compress “mystery” time; many players feel compelled to optimize, and those who don’t get filtered out. (Not a WoW-only issue, but amplified by the raid-treadmill culture WoW popularized.) ([Reddit][3])

**Why it matters:** If design assumes universal meta knowledge and perfect execution, everyday play constricts to pre-solved routes; exploration and role-play recede.

---

## 6) The counter-argument Fevir’s video provoked

* **“The genre matured, it’s fine.”** A vocal contingent argued MMOs weren’t dying; they were bigger and healthier, just different. In this view, nostalgia and shifting life circumstances—more work/family, less time—explain the dissatisfaction, not design rot. Those rebuttals are visible right in the 2015 thread. ([Reddit][1])

Fevir’s framing, though, wasn’t “MMOs are dead,” but that **the parts that made them special were systemically de-emphasized** as studios adopted the WoW template.

---

## 7) What Fevir-style remedies imply (design directions)

Reconstructing from how the community discussed “fixes” in response to the video, the implied prescriptions look like this:

1. **Rebuild server identity**

   * Fewer cross-realm hops; encourage stable, name-recognizable communities.
   * Reputation systems that persist beyond a single run; rewards for helpful play. ([Blizzard Watch][2])

2. **Dial back anonymous queues where it matters**

   * Keep teaching tools for entry-level content, but make the best experiences **world-located** and socially mediated (guilds, local recruitment, bulletin boards). ([Reddit][3])

3. **Horizontal progression & world value**

   * Make older zones, crafts, and activities evergreen via horizontal power, collection systems, social status items, or economic niches—so the world doesn’t become a museum after each tier.

4. **Interdependence without drudgery**

   * Bring back light-touch friction—roles that complement, professions that matter, logistics that reward cooperation—without resurrecting the worst timesinks.

5. **More sandbox, less ride-layout**

   * Public dungeons, contested resources, emergent PvE/PvP levers, live events that hinge on player action. The goal: generate stories *in* the world, not just parse charts *about* the instance.

6. **Design for mystery**

   * Randomize routes, seed secrets, and pace knowledge so the wiki can’t instantly flatten every puzzle. Let players *discover* again (and reward the discoverers).

These aren’t easy trade-offs—but they directly target the issues Fevir’s audience rallied around: anonymity, homogenization, and the loss of “world-ness.” ([Reddit][1])

---

## 8) Why this take stuck

The video resonated because it **named a feeling** many long-time players had circa 2015–2017: *MMOs were popular but felt spiritually thinner.* Whether or not you agreed, the specific pressure points—matchmaking over community, cross-realm over servers, treadmill over journey—kept surfacing in debates then and still do today. ([Reddit][1])

# Fevir 2025

Awesome—here’s a “Fevir 2025” update that keeps his thesis intact (“MMOs lost their ‘world-ness’ chasing the WoW template”) but grounds it in what’s happened since 2015, then a concrete checklist you can use while building your own MMO.

# What’s changed since 2015 (and what proved the point)

## 1) Players will flock to friction if it creates real stakes

* **WoW Classic Hardcore (Aug 24, 2023)** institutionalized permadeath with server-wide culture, *Mak’gora* duels to the death, and reputation that matters. Even Blizzard had to weigh community integrity after DDoS incidents—reviving affected characters precisely because stakes are the draw. ([Blizzard News][1])

* **Season of Discovery (2023–2024)**: class-altering Runes you *discover* in the world, phase-by-phase meta shifts, and light horizontalization (old reputations/professions refreshed). It showed that discovery + social knowledge beats lobby queuing for engagement. ([World of Warcraft][2])

**Takeaway:** friction that’s *purposeful* (reputation, scarce resources, discovery) makes people care about their server and stories again.

## 2) “World value” is back on the menu

* **OSRS seasonal Leagues** (Nov 2024–Jan 2025) turned the *journey* into the game: fresh characters, accelerated progression, task-driven exploration, and shareable builds—producing record participation highs across the franchise. ([Jagex][3])

* **Cataclysm Classic (May 20, 2024)** + the announced **Mists of Pandaria Classic (2025)**: the Classic pipeline keeps validating that players *want curated rewinds with modernized edges*—world spaces repurposed, not discarded. ([World of Warcraft][4])

**Takeaway:** design loops that keep old zones, crafts, and reputations relevant—don’t let the world become a museum after each tier.

## 3) Housing & personal spaces are surging (social glue, economy hooks)

* **Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds (Aug 20, 2024)** introduced account-wide **Homesteads** with hundreds of placeables; 2025’s follow-up (“Visions of Eternity”) adds *layout saving & XML-shareable builds*, hinting at a blueprint economy/community content layer. ([Guild Wars 2][5])

* **WoW “Midnight” (alpha Oct 2, 2025)** is bringing its own **player housing** alongside delves and other open-world systems—Blizzard explicitly pitching housing as a tent-pole social system. ([PC Gamer][6])

**Takeaway:** housing is no longer fluff; it’s a retention and creator-economy engine if you allow sharing, trading, and events around it.

## 4) Sandboxes keep proving durable where the *economy is the content*

* **Albion Online** remains the cleanest mainstream proof: *player-driven economy*, islands/farming, territory warfare, and full-loot risk. ([albiononline.com][7])
* **EVE Online: Havoc (Nov 2023)**: alignment with pirate factions, corruption mechanics, and corp projects—systemic factional levers that spawn emergent conflict. ([EVE Online Forums][8])

**Takeaway:** when systems feed each other (gather → craft → logistics → conflict → markets), your content *makes itself*.

## 5) Theme-parks didn’t stand still—but the “queue problem” persists

* **FFXIV “Dawntrail” (Jul 2, 2024)** is the gold standard of approachability (Duty Support, story-first), yet even XIV keeps investing in *non-queueable* side worlds (Island Sanctuary-style play) because players crave identity and place, not just instanced throughput. ([FINAL FANTASY XIV][9])

**Takeaway:** instant grouping is great *until* it dissolves your server fabric. Use it sparingly and surround it with world-located play.

# Design checklist: build your MMO to resist the “WoW template” gravity

You’re building a new MMO—treat the items below as **mechanics you must choose—on purpose**. Each is a lever against anonymity, homogenization, and world decay.

## A) Server identity & reputation

* **Named shards with permeability, not anonymity.** Allow limited cross-shard *travel* (permits trade & events) but bind most social actions (markets, guilds, territory) to home shards so names matter.
* **Reputation ledgers:** track commendations, guild service, logistics completed, successful rescues, and publish it *in world* (town boards, statues, banners).

## B) Purposeful friction (the fun kind)

* **Travel & logistics:** make hauling profitable and risky (escorts, wagons, airships). Logistics wins wars; it shouldn’t be a load screen.
* **Discovery loops:** embed *SoD-style* unlocks (class augments, professions) behind in-world sleuthing, not UI vendors. Support communal puzzle-solving. ([World of Warcraft][2])
* **Death stakes:** optional Hardcore rulesets or item/bank loss variants (a la Albion/EVE) with matching rewards & leaderboards—never just cosmetic. ([albiononline.com][7])

## C) Progression that keeps the world alive

* **90% horizontal, 10% vertical.** Power bands compress quickly; breadth (build options, synergies, collections) expands forever.
* **Evergreen old zones:** rotate OSRS-style tasks/leagues that *send* capped players back into lower tiers for profit, prestige, or unique augments. ([Old School RuneScape][10])
* **Seasonal experiments:** short Leagues with accelerated XP and unique rule mods; let winners mint tradable trophies/blueprints that persist across seasons. ([Jagex][3])

## D) Housing as a systems hub (not a dollhouse)

* **Blueprints are first-class:** players can save/export/import layouts (like GW2’s upcoming XML) and sell *plans* on your market. Gate some high-tier décor behind world events/raids to bind economies together. ([PC Gamer][11])
* **Public utility:** tie housing to farming, NPC hiring, crafting stations, bulletin boards, and *local buffs* (town beautification, festival set pieces) that matter to neighbors.
* **Showcase layer:** rotation of *featured homesteads* broadcast to shard; weekly housing quests create foot traffic and commerce.

## E) Matchmaking with boundaries

* **Zero anonymous queues for apex content.** Entry-level dungeons can autogroup; everything else is *world-located*—you travel to the door, post at the board, recruit, and run.
* **Guild tools > LFG:** robust in-game calendars, recruitment pipelines, and *mentorship rewards* so veterans onboard newbies for real.

## F) Economy is content

* **Scarcity & sinks:** regional resources, weight/volume, smuggling, and durability loss.
* **Player contracts:** hauling, crafting, bounty hunting, NPC caravan defense—all *contracted* via in-game escrow.
* **Creator economy:** cut of all blueprint/layout trades (housing, ship fittings, dungeon routes) goes to creators; rate-limit spam via reputation.

## G) Anti-spoiler design (fight the wiki)

* **Procedural variety:** puzzle components and drop tables rotate weekly; bosses have hidden “tells” that shift across seeds.
* **Fog-of-war knowledge:** map & bestiary fill per-character; sharing can be gated via craftable “field guides” (a sellable knowledge good).

## H) Live ops that drive *server* stories

* **Shard-level world meters:** corruption, weather, supply lines—let factions push these with play, unlocking new encounters (EVE Havoc-style levers). ([EVE Online][12])
* **Seasonal declarations:** publish a weekly newspaper (auto-generated from logs) that enshrines player deeds and declares “server firsts.”

---

# Quick examples to copy (and why)

* **Hardcore rule-set (opt-in):** stakes + social trust like WoW Hardcore; the drama sells itself. ([Blizzard News][1])
* **Discovery augments:** SoD showed “findable power” excites even veterans—do this across *all* roles (crafts, traversal, support). ([World of Warcraft][2])
* **Seasonal Leagues:** OSRS demonstrates “short, spicy, alt-friendly” is retention rocket fuel. Make trophy blueprints portable to main servers. ([Jagex][3])
* **Housing blueprints + sharing:** GW2’s homestead + layout files is the blueprint market you want from day one. ([PC Gamer][11])
* **Player-driven economy:** look to Albion’s island farming + full-loot tradeoffs and EVE’s alignment systems to seed emergent conflict. ([albiononline.com][7])
* **Theme-park polish without world rot:** FFXIV’s lesson—welcome mats are good, but keep marquee experiences world-located and socially mediated. ([FINAL FANTASY XIV][9])

## Bonus: guardrails for your production plan

1. **Ship with one frictionful “signature loop.”** (e.g., caravans + ambushes + bounties). Add queues later; never for your signature loop.
2. **Measure server health, not just MAU.** Track repeat-name encounters, contract completions between strangers, and “organic” group formation time.
3. **Tool the community.** In-game recruitment, bulletin boards, event kits, screenshot mode, layout exporting—less Discord dependency means more world presence.
4. **Plan for remixing.** From day one, your data model should support seasonal rulesets, rotating drop tables, and alternate shard physics.

If you want, I can turn this into a **founder design spec** for your MMO (| mechanics → telemetry → economy → content ops |), with a 6-month scope and first playable milestones (server identity + one friction loop + housing blueprints).
