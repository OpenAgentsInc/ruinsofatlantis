# Docs & Governance — 2025-10-04

Status
- Strong audit playbook and repo guidelines; previous audit snapshot present (2025‑10‑03).
- Input policy, Golden Commands, and deploy scripts documented.

Findings
- F-DOCS-008: Replace absolute user paths in docs with environment-variable examples or relative paths (P3 Low).

Recommendations
- Keep `src/README.md` current as renderer refactors land (attachments, pipelines, framegraph, replication upload paths).
- Update `GDD.md` if gameplay/system semantics change (e.g., server authority, replication cadence).
