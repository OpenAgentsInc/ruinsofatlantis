### Biome: The Atlantis Underdark

#### Overview

- A vast labyrinth of submerged tunnels, caverns, and trench‑vaults beneath the seafloor.
- Formed when Atlantis collapsed; cracked foundations slid entire districts into the deep.
- Waterlogged galleries, toxic air pockets, and fungal glow‑forests stretch for leagues.

#### Environmental Features

- Light: perpetual darkness punctuated by bioluminescent algae and fungal blooms.
- Water & Air: zones range from fully submerged to half‑flooded; some contain poisonous gas pockets.
- Hazards:
  - Collapsing ceilings and sudden floods.
  - Thermal vents scalding with superheated water.
  - Hallucinogenic spores from drowned fungi forests.
- Travel: treacherous; expect climbing gear, light sources, breathing apparatus, or magic.

#### Inhabitants

- Native predators: blind cave eels, giant crabs, albino sharks.
- Monstrous factions:
  - Deepfolk: twisted Atlanteans adapted to eternal night.
  - Mycelid colonies: intelligent fungal networks, hostile to intruders.
  - Abyssal spawn: otherworldly creatures leaking in from Shadowfell trenches.
- Ruin survivors: isolated enclaves of surface folk or exiles hiding from coastal kings.

#### Adventuring Themes

- Exploration: mapping endless caverns; discovering sunken shrines and vaults.
- Survival horror: low visibility, ambush predators, paranoia in the dark.
- Mystery: ancient Atlantean runes that hint at the city’s fall.
- Faction conflict: competing explorers (guilds, cultists) fighting for underground dominance.

#### Traversal Rules (Simulator)

- Movement Speed: halved without light or special senses.
- Stealth: native monsters gain advantages; intruders without proper gear suffer penalties.
- Resources: track food, oxygen, and light supply more strictly than surface zones.
- Random Hazards: collapses, floods, fungal spore events; tie to seeded RNG for determinism.

#### Expansion Hooks

- Planar leaks: Shadowfell energies bleed in; some tunnels function as literal gates.
- Lost cities: entire Atlantean metropolises intact but upside‑down, entombed beneath the sea.
- Boss arcs:
  - A fungal hivemind that “remembers” Atlantis.
  - A trench leviathan coiled through caverns.
  - Cults summoning abyssal gods using ruin‑conduits.

#### SRD Notes

- Terrain type: uses generic SRD term “Underdark.”
- Setting flavor: Atlantis ruin‑spin keeps mechanics SRD‑aligned while distinct to RoA.
