## SRD Scope & Implementation

Goal: near‑complete implementation of SRD 5.2.1 content, adapted for an MMO.

- Core Rules: abilities, proficiencies, d20 tests, conditions, damage types, movement, combat, rests, spellcasting, and leveling/proficiency progressions.
- Classes & Subclasses: all SRD classes and the subclasses contained in SRD 5.2.1; class features follow SRD rules unless MMO adjustments are explicitly documented.
- Backgrounds & Feats: SRD backgrounds, origin/general feats, and any SRD tables referenced.
- Spells: full SRD spell list (effects, components, durations, scaling, lists by class).
- Example spell mapping: see `docs/fire_bolt.md` for Fire Bolt (SRD 5.2.1) → sim‑data/spec translation.
- Equipment & Magic Items: weapons, armor, tools, gear, and SRD magic items with rules‑accurate properties and mastery tags.
- Monsters: complete SRD bestiary with stat blocks, actions, traits, and legendary/lair rules as present.
