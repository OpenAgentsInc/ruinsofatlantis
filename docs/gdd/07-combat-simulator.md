- The ocean’s dream‑reflection: brighter, lusher, overflowing with life.
- Sirens, fae‑like sea creatures, and enchanted kelp forests dominate.

### Shadowfell
- Reached through trenches, drowned crypts, or ghost‑ship crossings.
- Dark reflection of the sea—despair, death, and pressure of the depths.
- Drowned undead, abyssal predators, and shadowed Atlantean echoes.

### Inner Planes
- Plane of Water: the primal, infinite ocean.
- Plane of Earth: deep trenches, caverns, and volcanic ridges under the sea.
- Plane of Fire: hydrothermal vents and undersea volcanoes.
- Plane of Air: endless storms above the waves, winds that tear seas apart.
- Positive/Negative Energy: surging life‑currents and necrotic undertows.

### Outer Planes
- Canonical alignment‑tied planes reframed through an oceanic lens:
  - Mount Celestia: radiant reefs above the tides.
  - Nine Hells: volcanic trenches where devils are chained.
  - The Abyss: infinite whirlpools and bottomless rifts of chaos.
  - Mechanus: vast Atlantean tide‑engine regulating cosmic currents.

### Astral Plane
- A starlit sea navigable by astral ships; long‑distance and interplanar travel.
- Access via Atlantean gateways or dream‑navigation traditions.

### Ethereal Plane
- Felt as moonlit fogs, ghost‑ships, and drowned memories near the veil.
- Liminal space between Material and others; divers may slip through unintentionally.

### Biome: The Atlantis Underdark

#### Overview

- A vast labyrinth of submerged tunnels, caverns, and trench‑vaults beneath the seafloor.
- Formed when Atlantis collapsed; cracked foundations slid entire districts into the deep.
- Waterlogged galleries, toxic air pockets, and fungal glow‑forests stretch for leagues.

#### Environmental Features

- Light: perpetual darkness punctuated by bioluminescent algae and fungal blooms.
- Water & Air: zones range from fully submerged to half‑flooded; some contain poisonous gas pockets.
- Hazards:
  - Collapsing ceilings and sudden floods.
  - Thermal vents scalding with superheated water.
  - Hallucinogenic spores from drowned fungi forests.
- Travel: treacherous; expect climbing gear, light sources, breathing apparatus, or magic.
