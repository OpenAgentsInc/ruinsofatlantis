### Input & UI

- Hybrid cursor mode
  - Hold a modifier (e.g., Alt/RB) to unlock the cursor for UI; otherwise remain in mouselook.
- Immersion Mode
  - Optional preset hides waypoints, quest arrows, damage numbers, and any store/live‑ops panels. Off by default; toggle in HUD settings.
- Readable feedback
  - Small hit markers (off by default), concise status icons (Burning/Frigid/Stagger), and an on‑demand combat log. Plain‑language descriptions throughout.
