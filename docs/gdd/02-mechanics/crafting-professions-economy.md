### Crafting, Professions, and Economy

- Gathering professions
  - Mining, Herbalism, Fishing, Salvaging, Foraging—oceanic resources (pearls, corals, vent metals, abyssal fungi) with regional scarcity encourage trade and exploration.
- Crafting lines
  - Smithing/Armoring, Carpentry/Shipwright, Alchemy/Cooking, Enchanting/Inscription. Recipes discovered via exploration, faction favor, or experimentation.
- Player‑driven markets
  - Posted contracts and local auctioneers in hubs; no global instant delivery. Caravans and shipping create economic gameplay; piracy risk informs routes.
- Repair & durability
  - Items wear under stress; repairable via professions and SRD tools. Catastrophic failure is rare; mastery reduces costs.
- Economy guardrails
  - Bind‑on‑equip/pickup used judiciously. No monetized multipliers. Transparent drop tables and sinks (repairs, housing upkeep) stabilize currency.
