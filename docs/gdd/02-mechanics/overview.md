## Game Mechanics

Built on Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (SRD): iconic classes, races, spells, monsters, and d20 combat—fully implemented and tuned for a dangerous, persistent MMO world.

- Worldsmithing (in‑world creation): creators place trees and, later, props/NPCs directly in the game. See worldsmithing.md for UX and guardrails.
