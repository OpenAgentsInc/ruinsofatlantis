### Navigation & Wayfinding

- No glowy waypoints
  - Use in‑world guidance: smoke plumes, flocking birds, NPC scouts, footprints, rune whispers, and strong landmarks. Offer a map as an inspectable “paper” item rather than a permanent overlay.
- Guide NPCs
  - Players can ask a Guide to escort them to a site; the Guide physically leads, choosing interesting, safe(ish) routes and pausing at hazards.
