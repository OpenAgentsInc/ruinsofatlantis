### Lessons From Classic MMOs (Design Stance)

- Community & challenge
  - Meaningful penalties, tough dungeons, and teamwork are virtues—difficulty comes from the world, not UI friction. We provide information and readable mechanics.
- Class identity matters
  - Preserve distinct fantasies and class‑specific quests. Avoid homogenizing roles; balance by encounter and utility, not identical kits.
- Balanced QoL
  - Offer modern conveniences only when they don’t erode immersion (e.g., in‑world LFG boards/tavern posts; no teleport‑to‑dungeon menu). Travel and discovery remain core.
- Continuous improvement
  - In‑client surveys, PTR for major drops, and telemetry‑informed tuning while staying true to tenets. Candid patch notes explain “what” and “why.”
