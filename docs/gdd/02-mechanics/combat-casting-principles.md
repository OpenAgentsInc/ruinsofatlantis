### Combat & Casting Principles

- Line‑of‑Sight casting
  - Targeted spells succeed if the raycast has LoS to the aim point or target. “Out of range” does not invalidate a valid LoS shot; range instead affects travel time and optional falloff.
- Cast while moving
  - You can move during casts. Sprinting applies small tradeoffs (e.g., +10–20% cast time, minor cone spread). Channels break under heavy disruption.
- Fewer, heavier spells
  - Four core combat slots plus one ultimate. Longer cooldowns (8–25s core; 60–120s ultimate) with high impact (stagger, elemental status, destructible interaction). Cantrips bias toward mobility/utility over DPS spam.
- Friendly fire and physical lanes
  - Projectiles collide with allies/enemies. AI avoids firing through allies at short range; players can bait enemy fire.
- Default tunings (initial targets)
  - Projectile falloff: −20% damage per 30 m beyond effective range; no hard stop.
  - Moving‑cast penalty: +15% cast time; +10% cooldown; +10% spread for cone/bolt spells.
