### Player Experience Acceptance (Initial Targets)

- Casting with clear LoS succeeds regardless of distance; travel time and falloff apply.
- Casting while moving feels responsive; sprinting changes cast feel but not availability.
- Auto‑loot by proximity works; minimal clicking.
- Enemies can strike each other; players can bait friendly fire.
- Early‑game numbers are grounded and legible; damage spam is optional or off.
- Mobs grant meaningful XP; school proficiency advances utility.
- No glowy waypoints; a Guide NPC can physically lead you.
- Mount arrives believably; towns enforce etiquette.
- Boss ultimates drive phase changes rather than single‑press kills.
- HUD “Immersion Mode” hides out‑of‑world UI clutter (waypoints, sales).
