### Boss & Encounter Design

- Positioning and lanes
  - Enemies can hit each other; destructible cover and friendly fire create tactical play. Boss immunity windows are short and clearly telegraphed.
- Break bars & phases
  - Encounters use stability/break mechanics and phase transitions instead of sponge HP. Ultimates interact strongly with break bars (e.g., deplete ~35–45% when well‑timed) rather than deleting health.
