### In‑World Repair & Maintenance (SRD Tools + Mending)

Players can earn coin and reputation by repairing damage in the world using SRD tool proficiencies and spells.

- Eligible actions
  - Mending (cantrip): fixes a single break/tear up to 1 ft. in any dimension on a non‑creature object. Used for minor cracks, snapped rails, torn sails, and loose fittings.
  - Tool work: Carpenter’s Tools (wood), Mason’s Tools (stone), Smith’s Tools (metal), Tinker’s Tools (mechanisms). Applies to doors, bridges, hoists, stairs, railings, and town fixtures.
- Flow (in‑world jobs)
  - Damage occurs from combat or environment (e.g., a “hammer” swing breaks a door; siege in a port town damages railings).
  - Job boards and wardens post repair orders. Interact with the damaged object or board to accept a task.
  - Perform checks: use the relevant tool proficiency (with ability mod per SRD; DMG‑style DCs) and consume simple materials (wood/stone/metal scrap). Mending auto‑repairs qualifying small breaks without a check.
  - Rewards: small coppers/silvers and reputation with local authorities, guilds, or wardens on completion; larger payouts for critical structures or rush orders.
- Example
  - A brawl breaks a tavern door. A player with Carpenter’s Tools repairs it in‑world, earning 5 cp and +2 reputation with the Dock Ward. A wizard accompanying them uses Mending to fix cracked lantern glass for a small bonus.
- Simulator note
  - Repairs are environment events the sim can schedule (restore object integrity, clear hazards), not combat stats. Policies can choose to prioritize repairs during lulls or after encounters.
