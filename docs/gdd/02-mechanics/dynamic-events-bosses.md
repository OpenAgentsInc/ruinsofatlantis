### Dynamic World Events & World Bosses

- Emergent events
  - AI‑driven raids, sea monster attacks, faction ambushes, and environmental crises trigger from world state (over‑harvest, faction imbalance, weather), not fixed timers. Events can escalate when ignored.
- World bosses
  - Roaming or slumbering titans (krakens, leviathans, elemental colossi) appear dynamically and scale participation. Failure can strengthen them; success unlocks temporary boons, questlines, or caches.
- Impactful outcomes
  - Towns and outposts can be besieged, occupied, or liberated; NPCs may flee or return; markets fluctuate briefly. Player action visibly changes local state until recovery.
- Community play
  - Nearby players receive lightweight rally prompts; ad‑hoc cooperation is encouraged without hard scheduling. Progress is shared by contribution.
