### Loot & Economy

- Auto‑loot magnet
  - Auto‑pickup within ~2.5–4 m with rarity filters; expand radius while a key is held. No click‑spam.
- Fair, transparent rewards
  - Published loot tables; pity timers for extreme rares; bind‑on‑equip where it supports a healthy player economy. No monetized multipliers in core loops.
