### Spells, Focus, and Resource Feel

- Focus resource
  - A light resource that drains while sprint‑casting and refills quickly when steady. Movement and damage taken reduce Focus; landing precise hits restores a small amount.
- Cooldowns as primary gate
  - Core cooldowns 10–18 s; ultimate 60–120 s. Big casts have big consequences and readable wind‑ups.
- Voxel interaction
  - Spell ranks and Focus spent scale destructible effects (e.g., carve radius, ignite/soak, brittle/freeze) where appropriate.
