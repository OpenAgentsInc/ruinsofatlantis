### Mounts & Social Etiquette

- Believable mounts
  - Whistle summons from stables/nearby; mount runs to you; mount/dismount animations; no pop‑in beneath feet.
- Settlement manners
  - Auto‑dismount in town volumes and near authorities; some dialogues refuse while mounted; guards will bark if you ride indoors.
