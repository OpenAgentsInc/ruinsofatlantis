### Player Housing & Settlements

- Private homes
  - Claim plots in housing districts (coast, islands, underwater domes). Customize with furniture, trophies, and style kits. Benefits are convenience‑only (rested XP, storage, crafting benches, small gardens) to preserve non‑P2W.
- Open‑world placement
  - Homes exist in the world (in designated districts/frontiers) to form neighborhoods. Visitation permitted with privacy controls. Frontier capacity expands with population.
- Guild halls & settlements
  - Guilds can establish upgradable halls or freeports with defenses, vendors, and member buffs. These can attract dynamic events (e.g., raids) and tie into faction politics.
- Safeguards
  - Placement rules avoid griefing and maintain sightlines/performance; decay timers and upkeep are time‑based (not cash‑based).
