### Damage, Progression, and XP

- Grounded numbers
  - Early hits land at 10–60 damage, not thousands. Prefer tiers (Common/Elite/Boss) and resists over inflated health pools.
- XP from combat and adventures
  - Every enemy awards XP scaled by difficulty and streak/milestone bonuses. Quests/dungeons act as multipliers, not sole sources.
- School proficiency
  - Using a school (Fire, Frost, Force, etc.) grants small utility bonuses (e.g., −5% cooldown, +1 chain target, +0.2 s slow). Caps per region avoid grind; story beats grant bumps.
