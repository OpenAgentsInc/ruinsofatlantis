### Divine & Spiritual Classes
- Cleric: servants of sea gods, storm lords, and drowned ancestors; domains tied to tides, storms, lighthouse light, or stillness of the deep.
- Paladin: holy knights sworn to protect seafarers, coastal settlements, or Atlantean secrets; oaths bind them to Outer Planes patrons of justice or vengeance beneath the waves.
- Druid: stewards of reefs, currents, and the wild ocean; channel balance between sea and land and guide communities toward harmony with nature.

### Arcane & Mystical Classes
- Wizard: scholars of Atlantean relics and rune‑etched ruins; seek forbidden lore in flooded archives or astral tide‑charts.
- Sorcerer: innate casters shaped by planar tides—descended from storm elementals, sirens, or Atlantean bloodlines; magic manifests as waves, lightning, or abyssal whispers.
- Warlock: pact‑bound to beings beyond the Material—drowned gods, abyssal leviathans, or Feywild siren‑queens; gifts pull them toward Shadowfell trenches or Abyssal whirlpools.
- Bard: keepers of seafaring songs and lore; inspire crews, charm spirits, and preserve Atlantean myths through performance.

### Planar Integration
- Material Plane: Fighters, Rogues, Barbarians, Rangers—survivalists and adventurers.
- Feywild: Bards, Druids—music and nature in oceanic reflections.
- Shadowfell: Warlocks, some Rogues and Sorcerers—abyssal influence and drowned dead.
- Inner Planes: Barbarians, Druids, Sorcerers—primal ties to elements and tides.
- Outer Planes: Clerics, Paladins, Monks—divine oaths and cosmic order.
- Astral/Ethereal: Wizards, Warlocks—arcane travel, dream‑sailing, ghostly insight.


## Combat

SRD compliance
- Uses D&D 5th Edition (SRD) mechanics: d20 Attack Rolls vs. AC, Saving Throws vs. spell/save DCs, Advantage/Disadvantage, Conditions, damage types/resistance/vulnerability, critical hits, reach, and reactions (e.g., Opportunity Attack).
- Spellcasting respects SRD Casting Time, Concentration, Components (adapted for MMO UX), and the action economy (Action/Bonus Action/Reaction) mapped to real‑time pacing.

Real‑time adaptation (EverQuest‑style influence)
- Continuous time with global and per‑ability cooldowns; 6‑second “round” is a simulation target, not a literal turn system.
- Cast bars and weapon swing timers; taking damage triggers SRD Concentration checks and can interrupt long casts where appropriate.
- Threat/aggro tables and taunt mechanics guide NPC target selection; positioning and facing matter for some abilities.
- Crowd control (roots, stuns, sleeps, charms) is meaningful in open world; durations may scale by creature rank to preserve fairness.
