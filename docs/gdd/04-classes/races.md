## Class Lore

Pulled from SRD 5.2.1 classes; original names retained. This section frames how each archetype fits an Atlantis‑ruins, oceanic world and the SRD cosmology without renaming mechanics.

### Martial & Primal Classes
- Barbarian: survivors of storm‑wrecked coasts and open seas; rage as primal fury of currents and crashing waves; often tied to Inner Planes (Water, Storm, Earth).
- Fighter: backbone of naval militias, mercenary crews, and ruin‑delving expeditions; masters of harpoons, boarding pikes, and Atlantean relic‑arms.
- Rogue: smugglers, divers, and treasure‑hunters; adept at navigating wrecks, bypassing Atlantean wards, and thriving in lawless ports.
- Ranger: coastal wardens and beast‑bonded sailors; specialists in sea‑monster hunts across reefs and open water.
- Monk: ascetics who adapt discipline to currents and tides; train near thermal vents or cliff‑side monasteries to channel inner balance.
