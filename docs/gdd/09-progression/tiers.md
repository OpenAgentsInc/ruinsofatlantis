## Progression Matrix (Zones × Classes, Land Drama)

We keep standard D&D tiers (1–4 local heroes, 5–10 regional champions, 11–16 planar adventurers, 17–20 legendary figures) and map them to an oceanic + planar world with strong land‑based politics and a gold‑rush economy.

### Tier I: Levels 1–4 — Survivors & Local Heroes

Zones: fishing towns, coastal villages, frontier islands, shallow ruins newly revealed by tides.

- Land drama: petty kings, corrupt governors, and guilds try to monopolize ruins; mercenaries and smugglers race to sell finds.
- Class hooks:
  - Fighters/Rogues: hired blades for guilds or rebels.
  - Clerics/Paladins: protect shrines defiled by relic‑hunters.
  - Bards: spread songs of newfound wealth, warn of curses.
  - Wizards: first to study recovered Atlantean glyphs; Warlocks/Sorcerers feel planar pull.
- Quest themes: town defense from pirates, ruin‑scavenging, local court intrigue, protecting relic‑hunters from jealous nobles.

Player journey: establish survival and identity within the drowned world.

### Tier II: Levels 5–10 — Regional Champions

### Tier III: Levels 11–16 — Planar Adventurers
