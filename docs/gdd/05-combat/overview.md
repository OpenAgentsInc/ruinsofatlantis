- Dominate Mind hits the Ranger: Cleric pings the target with a low‑damage cantrip to force a new save; Wizard readies a disabling spell on the dominated ally if needed; party avoids lethal bursts.
- Cleric triage: Healing Word on the move; if Bless drops, re‑establish when safe. Can cast Protection from Evil and Good on a vulnerable ally to blunt further charm attempts.
- Monk uses mobility to tag adds, peel pressure, and interrupt a Lash window (if kit allows). Patient Defense covers dive transitions.
- Wizard prioritizes control and single‑target during spread mechanics; avoids Fireball if allies are Grappled to the boss.

Phase 3 (1:45–end): Legendary Pressure
- Bloodied, the aboleth escalates Lash usage and pairs Grapples with Consume Memories. Legendary Resistance may negate key stuns—party baits it with medium‑impact control before committing major cooldowns.
- Fighter uses Action Surge to stabilize threat after a dive; Indomitable on a failed Dominate save.
- Rogue maintains back position, times burst between Lash windows; Cunning Action to re‑acquire safe angle after knockback drifts.
- Ranger sustains single‑target; refreshes Ensnaring Strike after breaks; positions to maintain line of sight across platforms.
- Cleric commits a big heal window during predictable Grapple+Consume combos; preserves Concentration through incoming damage.
