## Philosophy

RoA embraces old‑school difficulty. Travel and logistics matter, resources are scarce, choices are meaningful, and death is painful.

In‑world interactions, not toggles. If a thing exists in the world—player, NPC, door, ship—you can use the same verbs on it: look, talk, trade, shove, steal, heal, curse, or strike. We do not add out‑of‑world switches like “PvP Enabled/Disabled” or invulnerability bubbles. Safety and norms are enforced in‑world (laws, wards, factions, guard response, bounties), not by breaking the simulation.

No pay‑to‑win. Players cannot spend real money to gain character power or gameplay advantages. You cannot buy levels, stats, gear power, spells, skill points, or combat bonuses with cash. Monetization, where present, focuses on cosmetics, account services, or QoL that do not affect combat power or competitive fairness. We may consider an official real‑money marketplace in the future (e.g., escrowed player‑to‑player trading), but it will not introduce exclusive power, progression skips, or superior items for money.

## Design Pillars

- Freedom of action
  - Cast while moving; projectiles are simulated; line‑of‑sight governs validity, not hard range cutoffs. Systems prefer physical causality over arbitrary toggles.
- Low‑friction play
  - Auto‑loot, minimal HUD by default, no monetization nags. Common actions flow with few clicks and limited mode switching.
- Readable power fantasy
  - Fewer, bigger spells with clear consequences and sane numbers. Progression is explainable at a glance.
- World respect
  - Avoid glowy waypoints. Prefer in‑world guidance (landmarks, scouts, signs). Mounts/NPCs behave believably.
- Tactical positioning matters
  - Enemies can hit each other; friendly fire exists; destruction changes cover and lines. Position and timing beat raw stat inflation.
